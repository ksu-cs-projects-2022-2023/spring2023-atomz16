I would suggest you invest in a pair since Manhattan typically floods whenever it rains and because it's pretty fun to stomp in puddles when you aren't worried about wet feet. \n\nEither way, campus is pretty great.

Are you doing pre-vet in the College of Agriculture or in Arts and Sciences? I would HIGHLY recommend the College of Agriculture (COA) route. I know a lot of the Animal Science and Industry professors will bend over backwards to get you to where you need to go. I'm not sure how it is on the other parts of campus, but I have never gotten a syllabus in the COA without a professor's cell and/or home phone number and they will tell you to call it (at a reasonable hour). They want you to succeed.  \n\nSomeone below also commented on the [Collegian.](http://www.kstatecollegian.com/) What they said is correct, you can be hired on for a job. But I would also recommend dual majoring or getting  a minor in [agricultural communications and journalism](http://www.communications.k-state.edu/academic-programs/agricultural-communications-and-journalism/) if you are going the COA route. It's a great program that would work well with your writing and animal interests. (Plus, later on down the road you get to work on a real magazine that gets published).\n\nI love Manhattan. It's a beautiful city, and it definitely feels like home to me. Aggieville is a great place, both for bar hopping, small scale concerts, eating and shopping. Aggie Central Station has a variety of concerts, but I'm not sure if those under 21 are allowed. It's close to KC, so big concerts almost always come there as well. \n\nGet athletics tickets. Actually go to games. Go to free games (volleyball, baseball, women's basketball, etc.) It's a great Division I athletics school. Hike the Konza Prairie frequently. Go to the theater both on campus and in the community. Drive around the Flint Hills. If you're bored in Manhattan, Kansas, it's you that's the bore.\n\nBut seriously, welcome to K-State.

I've lived in Goodnow, Marlatt, and Boyd dorms, and enjoyed Goodnow the most, largely because for whatever reason people on the floors tended to arrange a lot of floor-wide activities. The Collegian is pretty fantastic, and I'd highly recommend getting involved. Laura Meyers in the new opinion editor for next year and she's a sweetheart. I'd recommend shooting her a message on Facebook. It's neither a class nor a club. The town is pretty meh to me. Not trashy as a whole, but I'm not a big fan of country music or small town 'Murica, so that's probably why. Most of the things to do here revolve around Aggieville (tons of bars and diners plus some kitschy shops) and house parties. It's a small college town in KS, so drinking is generally a big social activity. The academics I would say are great, but I say that coming from a background of loving school. I'm in the political science department, and the professors are really top notch. I was accepted into several top schools and went with K-State due to in-state tuition and the lineup for professors. The vet med program is fantastic. In regards to loving reading and writing, most of the creative people I meet tend to hang around Bluestem Bistro and Radina's, two local coffee shops in Aggieville. I too love concerts and rock music, and that's very much lacking here. Good places for live rock and alternative simply do not exist here. Lawrence (a two hour drive away) has a really solid music scene and it's been pretty common for people to carpool for concerts. The best chill hangout for me thus far has been Auntie Mae's; poetry slams, pool, good music, and some of the most interesting people tend to congregate there, as opposed to the gang bang, let's act like white thugs crowd at Kite's or the country boys at So Long Saloon. Bluestem is pretty affordable for food. They do $5 lunch specials and have world dinner with a bunch of different options. Noodles and Co. is also a favorite of mine because you can get a large pasta and drink for $8. Pizza Shuttle is also pretty good, small one topping pizza and drink for $6 that feeds me for lunch and dinner.",

If you're lucky enough to get an adviser that will actually help you that will be a miracle but when it comes to the deans and such. Just expect them to give 0 fucks what happens to you and everything they do (if they actually do it) takes 3-4 weeks. \n\nHonestly, I grew up the child of alumni and used to be SO excited to come but in the last year, I realize I have wasted more money to be screwed time and again than I even knew was possible. If you do come get EVERYTHING in writing and assume that you will not be helped by anyone but your peers and the occasional awesome teacher (don't get me wrong not everyone is a dick but the people who make things happen usually are). \n\nEdit- the people here can be really cool but honestly if you're coming for school be ready to be pretty unimpressed. Also the vet grad program has made one of the people I know have \"the worst time in his whole life, there's no way he would tell someone to go into it\" so... definitely talk to some upper class-men so you know what you're getting in to.

There's not ALL that much to do in town before you turn 21, but the are plenty of on campus clubs and activities to take part in(check out the KSU Airsoft Team if you like that sorta thing... shameless plug for my personal club of choice). Check out the club fair at the beginning of the year to see all those organizations. And there's always intramural suff you're an athlete. \n\nAcademics are about the same as any university's. Not to hard if you just keep up on the class work. Professors vary from class to class obviously, but generally if you put in the effort to do the work and actually engage the professor (ask questions, visit them during office hours, etc) you'll find them very helpful and genuinely interested in your education. \n",

There's some *huge* rooms (they're actually all suites) in Van Zile, but you'd have to go down to the basement or first floor to socialize much since there's no lobby space elsewhere.  Not sure about lobby space over in Putnam, but it does have some oddities that you can only attribute to age. Strong has the nicest dining hall by far, but it's closed on weekends and you'd have to eat at one of the other dining halls. AFAIK, they like to use Van Zile for international students almost exclusively.\n\n**Derby Complex**: Four residence hall towers (Moore, Haymaker, Ford (girls only), West). West is probably the worst of them (it's kind of run-down), so put it last on your request if possible. Lived in Moore for two years. It's great (albeit a little crowded at times), and all two-person rooms with a community bath, which means you'll have to socialize a bit every time you want to use the restroom. There's also a lobby on each floor, which is good for socializing unless there's just a couple of really strange people on your floor that practically live out there.^^^Seriously, ^^^get ^^^a ^^^room! They like to put a lot of the international students in there because it's open year round. If you're arriving really early, you'll probably be placed there. Haymaker is also great and very similar to Moore in a lot of ways, except that one wing, or half the building, is suites and there are a ton more athletes. The Derb has the most options for food of any dining center on campus. \n\n**Kramer Complex**: I'll have to defer to someone else on what the two residence halls (Goodnow and Marlatt) are like, but the dining center is decent, but smaller because it has to serve less people than the Derb. Also, they're building a new residence hall, so this area might be a mess, especially next spring.\n\n... and that's about it. If you have any questions, feel free to ask. ",

Blue is on the board of the Hudson Institute, a noted conservative think tank. . . \n\n> Over the years, Blue, his brother, and General Atomics and its employees have made millions of dollars of campaign contributions to local, state, and federal politicians that have helped reinforce the company's position as one of the nation's most successful military contractors, receiving billions of dollars from federal taxpayers.\n\n> GA also operates a multi-national uranium mining and reprocessing business, regulated and funded in part by the federal government, and conducts government-sponsored research and development efforts on everything from gun rails to algae-based jet fuel. . . \n\n> \"For decades the entitlement psychology has relentlessly decoupled the biblical and basic understanding that in order to eat, one must be productive.\"\n\n> \"Many people, far too many people, believe the role of government is to care for them,\" the authors add. . . \n\n> Top political beneficiaries of the Blue brothers' largesse range from Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein to GOP Congressman Brian Bilbray. \n\n> Recently the firm has been lobbying Congress against defense budget cuts.\n\n> And troubles with the clean-up of old uranium facilities in Colorado have long dogged a company-owned subsidiary there.",

I know, he's the best coach in that program's history, I got that. But, that also means you're a bit deprived of the understanding that there ARE multiple capable coaches out there that can keep things running extremely well. Programs with a bit more history have gone through ups and downs because they search for the right coach, and your first selection doesn't always pan out. That doesn't mean we should have to go back and hire Lou Holtz again.\n\nHe WAS an absolute miracle worker when he pulled that place from Helm's Deep, but seriously, there have to be multiple people out there who can continue the direction. Just because Ron Prince came in for a 3 years and sucked at it doesn't mean nobody else can. Life is about trial and error, most of the time. ND had to go through Davie, Willingham, and Weis, before we could find a coach that could make us somewhat competitive on a yearly basis nationally.\n\nI WANT KSU to do well, but it's getting absurd the amount we have to hear about the guy being called the best ever.

Everyone strikes gold once, not everybody ever gets to hold onto a coach that long though.\n\nKSU is a high profile job, BECAUSE of what Snyder did, so it'll always be compared back to him. Take every team ND will ever field for the rest of time. They'll be compared back to the \"good old days\" at every turn. Even I do it now. Stupid nostalgia. Once you set a standard, it remains in place until something else comes along to raise that bar even further.\n\nI think that once he leaves, it's entirely possible that you can land a coach that, in the first 10 years after his departure, will find KSU's way into the CFB playoff, giving them an actual shot at a NC, something Snyder hasn't quite been able to ever deliver, however so close on many occasions. 3 years isn't long enough to tell what's going to happen (a la Prince). Shoot, BK didn't do so hot in the first few years either.\n\nI think the mold is there, and the energy around the program is there. They just have to learn to maintain it AFTER his inevitable departure. If your fanbase is only showing up now, and will just abandon ship after he's out, then they don't deserve a good program at all. That sounds harsh, and I don't intend it to be, but I think anybody would agree.

Snyder\u2019s table always had the longest line and my manager instructed us to make sure we cut off the line 15 minutes before the scheduled end time otherwise Bill would be there all night. Well Snyder noticed that fans were being turned away at the back of his long ass line and asked one of the interns what was going on. The intern explained that it was almost closing time so they were needing to cut off the line, Bill says \u201cno go get those fans back in line\u201d and stayed there probably 2 extra hours to make sure everyone who wanted an autograph got one.

I'm a big fan of The McGuyver , which are plate sized pancakes with anything you want added to them. They have an incredible atmosphere with awesome music and a huge selection of breakfast cocktails, if you're feeling frisky. Seriously. Go to The Chef. \n\nBluestem Bistro: \n\nMy favorite little coffee shop in the heart of Aggieville. They serve awesome coffee and specialty espresso drinks, and some pretty good sandwiches. \n\nAJ's Pizza: \n\nWay better than Doughboys. They have their location near the mall on Poyntz, but the real draw is their Aggieville location on 11th. Huge slices of pizza with gourmet toppings, only open after 10 on weekends. You'll see everyone you know here after a night out \n\nAs for bars, the world begins and ends at Auntie Mae's. Mae's is the hipster haunt of Manhattan. It's not a fancy bar, nor is it well lit or particularly inviting. It began as a speak easy during the prohibition era that was fronted by a tool store. The titular Mae ran her bar out of the basement, where it remains to this day. This was and is THE bar for my friends and I. I haven't lived in Manhattan for over a year, and I still get waved through by the door guys. Their signature drinks are the tarantula, which is a version of a Long Island that will murder you; Moscow Mules, always on special; and $1.75 PBR and High Life cans. \n\nIf you are a beer person, I would recommend Rock a Belly Deli, which has a pretty sold collection of rotating taps. It's a very \"grad student\" bar.\n\nAggie Station makes a hell of a cocktail and has a clientele of older students and young graduates, and as an fun yet controlled vibe. It was usually where we ended our nights in the Ville. \n\nI apologize for what I'm sure are egregious formatting and spelling/grammar errors. Alienblue is hard sometimes. \n\n\n\n",

        "body": "This actually inspired me to attempt something similar. Last year I dropped ~40lbs in under two months doing pure calorie restriction (215lbs-175lbs). The big difference being that I ate healthy and took a multivitamin/probiotic/fish oil. I wouldn't recommend people do this without plenty of research. It was very difficult at times.\n\nAfterwards, I did gain some of the weight back over the course of the year, but this was expected because I didn't do a full-lifestyle change and fell back into my old ice cream/beer habits. I am actually currently attempting it again, but this time hope to commit to some real lifestyle changes afterwards (way more difficult than the diet itself imho).\n\n**EDIT:** STORY TIME. Although this study inspired me it's not the full picture. What I did was a crash diet, which is why I wouldn't recommend attempting this without plenty of research or speaking with a qualified professional. I was also heavily influenced by [this study](http://pmj.bmj.com/content/49/569/203.short), along with plenty of other articles/research.\n\nTo be clear, I didn't just do this on a whim. Prior to the crash diet I had attempted changing my lifestyle habits many times, usually a mix of 'normal' calorie restriction and exercise, but I had not been able to get anything to stick more than a few months and saw minimal changes. In fact, I had spent most of my life very skinny and struggled to GAIN weight. I had done several smaller crash diets before, losing ~10lbs in under a month, but nothing this extreme. Most of the weight I gained was put on relatively recently (physical job->desk job, and lots of stress eating during my wife's first pregnancy). Based on past attempts I realized that at this point I realistically could only sustain lifestyle changes for a few months, so I decided to go hard and see what I could accomplish.\n\nI am a relatively young 6' male with a medium/small frame. I cut my daily calories down as close to the bare minimum as I could, which I figured was around 1000kcal/day. When I started, It was floored about how fast the weight came off. I would weigh myself every day, and see myself .25-1lbs less (obviously the weight loss started big but slowed over time).  As opposed to the more traditional kind of dieting where your goal is lose a few pounds a month, seeing actual weight changes every day was incredibly motivating.\n\nIt HAD to be motivating though, because it was very tough. Along with always being hungry (although you do get used to the feeling) and feeling tired all the time, there were some days where you would feel light-headed or sick to your stomach. The original goal was to go three months. The first month was fine actually, after a couple weeks I enjoyed the feeling of being hungry and probably ate less that 1000kcal. HOWEVER, late into the second month I started to really feel the effects. I finally failed when a bunch of friends and I spent a weekend together, and they were eating pizza/snacks/alcohol.\n\nThat said, I managed to stay the same weight for ~10 months afterwards, only starting to gain again when my wife became pregnant with our second child. There are lots of studies showing the pregnancy weight gain impact on men, so my second attempt is actively trying to stop this from happening again. Interestingly enough, the past year there have been a lot of studies about crash diets and their effectiveness (I might just notice them more), and even health benefits associated with them. HOWEVER I still stand by my suggestions that you DO NOT ATTEMPT THIS without plenty of research and professional guidance.\n\n**Breakdown:**\n\n* Breakfast: Lots of Black Coffee/Tea/Water.\n* Lunch: Large piece of fruit and a single-serve yogurt. ~300kcal\n* Dinner: Huge amount of vegetables, a normal size portion of lean meat/fish. ~600kcal\n* Snacks: Small piece of cheese OR small bowl salted popcorn. ~100kcal\n* Other: Multivitamin, Probiotic, Fish Oil.\n\ntl;dr I did a crash diet using only calorie restriction, limited myself to 1000kcal/day, lost ~40lbs in 2 months.",

        "body": "I have been on a similar diet but not eating complete garbage. Its pretty simple look at how many callores you can burn in a hour then compare that to a meal. Common meals are 3 times or more calories than working out for an hour (depends what you do and what you eat obviously).\n\nSo in this example cutting your calorie intake to 2/3 of what you normally eat (which is probally too much anyway) is about as good as working out for an hour a day.\n\nNow if you can do some working out and slightly improve what you eat you are really in business. I also think cutting back on carbs is really good but bread is a pretty big food love for me.\n\nThat's the real question what can you do for the rest of your life: eat less, exercise, eat better or a combination of the three?\n\nFor me right now its eat less and work out a little, I will try and eat a bit better but if you try and do too much you just give up. Only do what you are happy to do forever and don't make yourself miserable by trying to cut out things you love. I see this a lot, people cut food they love out to loose weight (burgers, chocolate etc) then wonder why they gave up after a month or two. One thing I've tried with burger places is just get a diet drink and less or no chips, the burger itself is not the end of the world its when you add on a massive pile of chips , sauces and a cup full of sugar (or if its the chips you love get chips but no burger).\n\nThe other quick thing I'll mention , if like me you spend 8+ hours a day in front of a computer sitting on your ass you basically are going to need to count calories or watch your weight in some way. Its not genetics , you are not unlucky you need to realise there has to be a link between how much you eat and how active you are , makes sense but I don't think many people think of it that way.",

The point is nobody can make that decision for you. Just know Missouri state has some of the nicest people in the world and professors will do everything they can to support. Youd have fun at MSU but idk if thats where you want to be.",
