I recommend mapping it out using the course requirements published online. 12 hours is the minimum to be a full time student, 18 is the max for block rate tuition. I recommend 15 to start and to carefully select classes if taking 18 to make sure you can handle the work each requires. \n\nIf you want to double major, some people do have AnSci/AgBus doubles, but the cert might be a little harder to squeeze in once you do that.

It\u2019s absolutely terrible if you can get a spot in the tiny lot attached to the building be careful about who you park by (nobody was ever parked straight and the spots are really narrow). If you can\u2019t park by the building there is a limited amount of street parallel parking and a gravel lot down the road. The gravel lot floods when it rains and snows and has no easy to drain so you just have to wait for it to dry up. Kids did donuts a lot so it was always muddy. Then the building itself is terrible. A lot of us thought that there were bats in the walls because we always heard like scratching and stuff. The AC sucks. If you can get someone to hack it you will have to do that. I swear it never got below 70 even when the thing on the wall said it was. The fire alarms went off almost 10 times( none of them being real fires) and we usually never got a full explanation as to why. One even went of during break when there were like 10 of us in the building. The lounges (at least on the west 2nd floor) were kind of gross and for like 1/3 of the year we only had one working washer. One would break every two weeks or so. Personally speaking, I had one conversation with my CM when I moved in and one when I moved out. He didn\u2019t really care for his job and pretended not to know me outside of the building. The walk to class sucks when it is rainy, snowy, or cold but especially when it\u2019s hot. On occasion the buses would not be running our route and we only found out through the group chat. There is so much wrong with this building.  On the bright side there is a convenient store downstairs and the mail come directly to the building:\u2019)",

I had a 1 hour layover in Kansas City while they cleaned the bus.  One time a guy came by asking for $3, and I gave him a $20 and asked him to bring me the change.  He walked towards the service counter, and I kept an eye out, and when he didn't come back after a few minutes, I walked up there and realized that the bus station had a front door as well as a back one!  I had never seen it because it was sort of around a corner from the back area.  So, the man was gone with my whole $20, and I had to go without eating anything that day.",

        "body": "Hi, I just finished my degree in computer science this december 2022. 90% of my computer science courses were online. Heres my 2 cents.\n\nOklahoma in general is pretty bad in terms of Computer Science education. I'd argue its one of the worst states in the nation for computer science. OSU is no exception.\n\nThere are a few golden teachers, Christopher Crick, Blayne Mayfield, Rammnath, Joshi Shital, and Jim Burkman. These instructors are very helpful, and half have \"late penalties\" in case you have to turn in a programming assignment a couple days late. Dont recommend that tbh.\n\nAssuming you want to become a software engineer, or a similar tech adjacent field, getting a 4-year degree is still the most influential factor in getting that job. By trade schools, im assuming you meant bootcamps, most are scams. Yes, there are people who get software engineering jobs without degrees and only bootcamp experience, but those are super rare exceptions.\n\nOne super important point id like to make is: Dont rely on the degree/university to make you marketable for software engineering jobs. The degree doesnt teach you how to build complete applications, instead, they give you a problem, and you solve it through programming and or math(still useful). As soon as you pass the intro class, you should start leetcoding, and making small fullstack applications/projects. After you have a couple decent projects, start applying for internships.\n\nThere is one golden class: MSIS 3333 Database Management with Jim Burkman. Imo, this is a must have course. Even though its an MSIS course its still super beneficial to CS students since Databases are super important for software engineering. The knowledge i gained in there literally got me an internship and a full time software engineering job that i have right now. \n\nAnother point: just because a class is hard doesnt meant its a bad class. \n\nNote: The workload is intense. I worked 15-30 hours a week and ive had to do several all-nighters each semester. I have 2 friends,one switched from business degree to Comp Sci, another switched Comp Sci to some Aviation degree. They both said that the Business/Aviation workload is an absolute joke compared to it(Not trying to put down those degrees). \n\nI dont really understand your question about hours.\n\nLmk if you have any other questions.",

There are many classes in the first year where you\u2019ll be learning everything such as Python and SQL. These classes assume you have no experience already so anybody is able to succeed in them. The hardest class I\u2019ve taken so far is the Statistics class which you\u2019ll take in the first semester. As you\u2019ll expect with a masters program, it will require more effort than a undergraduate degree to succeed. For me, I had to change my habits because I was an ultra procrastinator in undergrad and didn\u2019t study until it was necessary for exams. \n\nMy biggest complaint so for is that the BAN core classes feel very disorganized. Luckily for you, I\u2019ve communicated that with the program director (Dr. C) and the \u201c2nd in command\u201d (Dr. McGaugh). The entire first and second semesters of BAN classes are getting an overhaul. Dr. McGaugh asked me for my feedback on how she\u2019s structuring the classes for next year and it got me excited and I got the feeling of wanting to retake the classes again. \n\nBe aware that you\u2019re not going to graduate from the program an expert in data analytics. This program is designed to get you a job out of college and will give you the foundation so that if you need to you can learn while on the job.\n\nIf you have any more questions just let me know. I\u2019ll be 100% honest.",

Makes our campus feel like a giant strip mall.\n\nBUT, before you all flame me, I find it very unacceptable to make this big of a change mid-semester without a concession. Student residents certainly need parking, sure, but would it really hurt that bad to give-out the remaining garage permits to affected silver commuters (for free, first come, first serve)? Frankly, I am puzzled why we price the garage parking so high that so few people actually use it. The parking garage next to the McKnight Center, for example, is probably less than half full on the busiest of days.  Students are our future alumns, our best recruiters, and our best branders (better than sports!).\n\nSo much of our administration is penny wise, pound foolish.",

We are just not well connected to the broader community.\n\nBack to the parking -- I don't have an insider connections to the parking people, otherwise, I'd make the personal push on this.

I would recommend not joining the guard ahead of time unless you need the money for school as this will just delay commissioning and the higher money flow on the officer side.

I started full online and have transitioned to the Hybrid program\n\n1. There are some extra fees for business school, etc. but I\u2019m not exactly sure if there are any for the online program specifically. \n2. Hybrid and online, you have 7 years to complete your degree. It really is go at your own pace.  \n3. The vast majority is pre recorded lectures with associated homework. Most classes have video lectures and some form of a quiz or homework to turn in at the end of every week. There are a couple of classes that have a few in person zoom calls. Dr. Bowler\u2019s Organizational Behavior class comes to mind. He has a few \u201cfireside chats\u201d through the semester. They\u2019re usually about an hour and they\u2019re not every week or anything. Just about every class has some group work, so you\u2019ll also need to budget time for those when they come up. OSU really wants the hybrid and online students to have group discussions and interactions and it shows. \n4. It really depends on your undergrad in my experience. If you\u2019re undergrad was in business you\u2019ll recognize many concepts and a lot will feel like a refresher. If your undergrad is in something else you may find it more difficult. \n\nI\u2019m happy to help you out with any other info you need. I\u2019m enjoying the program so far and I\u2019m glad I decided to do it",

For those classes that were hybrid it was a professor recording the class and posting the video that day and/or also streaming the class live. With online classes sometimes you can work ahead since most of the material opens early and the requirements are usually just that you complete specific quizzes before certain dates. For online group discussions I started noticing many students doing the bare minimum when posting replies which gets boring but not a big deal. \n\nFor business classes the course work is moderate to easy. I never had a class I was pulling my hair out with. Business school isn\u2019t like Engineering or STEM. Just put in the work and you\u2019ll do fine. \n\nI would say the best thing I got out of Spears was the networking and access to campus recruiting. It was invaluable to help me find a job and have multiple offers almost a year before graduating.",

In Stout, you have your own sink and thermostat in the room, and I think that reduces a LOT of discomfort other dorms have. \n\nI will say, I did not have the most fantastic community experience at Stout and made friends elsewhere, but I think the COVID year kind of destroyed Stout\u2019s community and it\u2019s slowly rebuilding itself.

In fact they only made it worse (but this could be a campus wide issue).\n\nThe parking around the building is a nightmare to get out of because of all the extra blind spots when trying to back out. I almost get hit basically everyday. \n\nIt\u2019s some what of a long walk to BPS and buildings like Endeavor, Spears, Morrill hall, and O\u2019brate. \n\nIt\u2019s a really far walk if you have to go to NOC.\n\nThe Wi-Fi is hit or miss a lot\n\nPros:\nYou are close to a lot of the gen ed buildings and Ag Hall.\n\nYou are close to Kerr-Drummond, so you can get food easily. \n\nYou are close to a parking garage \n\nYou can easily walking to places off campus. \n\nAnd just walking to places on campus is faster. \n\n\nThose are about all the pros and cons of living here. \n\nTLDR: It\u2019s okay, but there are a lot of improvements needing to be made.",

I have been in my full time career the whole time and am full time working and taking classes at the same time. \n\nI don\u2019t know about the forensic science program, but the MBA program is super flexible. I feel like OSU knows the students who are choosing online or hybrid are doing it because they have other commitments on their time. The courses I have taken fully online have been enough work to keep you engaged, but not so much that I\u2019ve felt under pressure. You are free to take as many courses as you want during a semester. So if you know you will be having a full couple of upcoming months you are free to dial down to one or two classes. \n\nThe certificates are a great addition. I\u2019m doing one of those with my MBA. Essentially for the MBA program you need 3 electives in order to graduate. If they\u2019re all in the same area and you take one more while you\u2019re here you get a whole 2nd degree then you graduate. \n\nHappy to help if you need any more info!",

That isn\u2019t exactly the safest part of the city (especially after dark) so please stay alert and be careful talking to strangers.

It\u2019s a great engineering school - better than TTU and OSU - but it\u2019s a commuter school at its core so there won\u2019t be as big of a social scene comparatively.\n\nI\u2019d recommend looking into the student population diversity statistics if that\u2019s something that\u2019s important to you as well. It won\u2019t tell you the full picture but might help you out some with answering questions. Good luck on whatever decision you make!",

Set your thermostat to HEAT and set the temperature to over 65.\n\nThe issue is that many of these students either forget, don't see the email due to their already overflowing inbox, don't know at all, don't care, or have a roommate that stays later than them and undoes everything that they did.\n\nThere is absolutely nothing you can do to prevent pipes from freezing without deconstructing the entire campus and reinstalling heated and/or well insulated pipes, all you can do is the steps above to help significantly reduce the likelihood of it happening.\n\nI can't say much above Wentz as it is a community bathroom type of dorm, so I don't know who is held responsible in doing the winter stuff but in the Villages, those dorms are a suite type of dorms where the bathrooms are in each room and the students are held responsible in doing their winter stuff.",

It\u2019s a good location and modern kitchen but dated bedrooms. There are other options but isn\u2019t the cheapest and most convenient.\nIts definitely worth getting the sports pass which was $250 but gets you into every sporting event all year, including all football and basketball games. It's a whole different experience! Try and make American friends to tailgate with as it\u2019s by far the best part of gameday! \nIt's a beautiful little college town and campus but it can get a little boring on non-gameday weekends, especially as theres no way to get to OKC without a car, though you can go to Tulsa on the orange bus. If you can afford it, get a licence and a cheap car, it will make such a difference as public transport basically doesn't exist. \nOnce you turn 21 (or just before it), go to the DMV in town and get an ID as most places don't accept passports if you want to drink. Union, college bar and Murphys are the busiest and funniest bars in my experience, but if you wanna see line dancing and cowboy hats, go to Outlaws. Also, Thursday is the main drinking night in the bars. Drinking on game day is acceptable but never do it in public outside of gameday, you will get arrested (will also get arrested in drunk in public!)- stupid I know. \nTry to make as many American friends as possible as they will be able to host parties and drive you around- they are overly friendly so it isn't too difficult- they are also much more talkative then foreigners (especially Brits like me). \nDon't get the meal plan, it's way cheaper to self cater, you can cancel the meal plan at the start of the semester in the SU (you will need to buy a minifridge as the kitchen fridges tend to be full and stuff gets taken). \nTake full advantage of travelling as much as you can, especially over winter and spring break, internal flights are way cheaper than flying from Europe. I\u2019d recommend Kansas City, Austin, Chicago and Texas. \nTry Eskimo Joe's loaded Fries (but nothing else as the rest of the menu is meh) and go to Braums which is a local fast food chain (their burgers and shakes are awesome!) \nThe classes are way easier compared to UK university, but its a lot more workload so you have to manage time well (like lots of GCSE/A-level homework), easy A's/B's! You'll have a great time, go pokes!",

Outside of that and football games, the town is pretty quiet. Campus is bustling during school of course, but when class isn't in session, campus is quiet too. \n\nThere's a lot of open fields and cows around Stillwater, so there's a lot of country vibes. I would recommend Stillwater if that's what you're looking for. We're not devoid of shops and restaurants, though. There's a wide range of good restaurants to try.\n\nIt's about an hour's drive to either of the major cities (Oklahoma City and Tulsa), and there's a bus that drives to Tulsa multiple times a day. The Tulsa bus puts you downtown, so if you're wanting a taste of the city vibes that's an option. \n\nMost of the people there are friendly and would be very happy to meet you. You might see a couple crazy right-wing messages, but in my experience most people aren't like that. The town is safe. I have gone out walking around campus at night multiple times, and I'm a woman. \n\nI hope that helps!",

I like you\nYou're not like the other people here, in the trailer park\n\nOh, don't go get me wrong, they're fine people, they're good Americans, but they're content to sit back, maybe watch a little Mork and Mindy on channel 57, maybe kick back a cool Coors 16-ouncer...\nThey're good, fine people, Stuart but they don't know what the queers are doing to the soil\n\nYou know that Jonny Wurster kid, the kid that delivers papers in the neighborhood? He's a fine kid. Some of the neighbors say he smokes crack, but I don't believe it. Anyway, for his tenth birthday, all he wanted was a burrow owl. He kept bugging his old man; \"Dad, get me a burrow owl! I'll never ask for anything else as long as I live!\" So the guy breaks down and buys him a burrow owl\nAnyway, 10:30 the other night, I go out in my yard and there's the Wurster kid, looking up in the tree! I say \"What are you looking for?\" And he says \"I'm looking for my burrow owl!\"\nAnd I say \"Jumpin' Jesus on a pogo stick! Everybody knows the burrow owl lives in a hole in the ground! Why the hell do you think they call it a burrow owl, anyway!?\"\nNow Stuart, do you think a kid like that is going to know what the queers are doing to the soil?\n\nI first became aware of all this about ten years ago, the summer my oldest boy, Bill Jr., died. You know that carnival comes into town every year? Well this year they came through with a ride called The Mixer. The man said \"Keep your head and arms inside The Mixer at all times.\" But Bill Jr., he was a daredevil, just like his old man!\nHe was leaning out saying \"Hey everybody, look at me! Look at me!\" POW! He was decapitated! They found his head over by the snow cone concession!\nA few days after that, I open up the mail And there's a pamphlet in there from Pueblo, Colorado, and it's addressed to Bill Jr., and it's entitled Do You Know What the Queers Are Doing to Our Soil?\n\nNow Stuart, if you look at the soil around any large US city with a big underground homosexual population, Des Moines Iowa, for example. Look at the soil around Des Moines, Stuart, you can't build on it, you can't grow anything in it, the government says it's due to poor farming, but I know what's really going on, Stuart! I know it's the queers! They're in it with the aliens! They're building landing strips for gay Martians, I swear to God!\n\nYou know what, Stuart? I like you\nYou're not like the other people, here in the trailer park",

And it's REALLY hard to schedule with SEC  teams that spreads non conference games out all season (while every other conference including the Big12 has them the first few weeks).  Either OSU has to give up a mid-to-late season bye week (which is valuable) and align that with OU's non conference schedule or the one date that OU has in the early season for a non conference game has to work-out for OSU as well.\n\n\\-----------------\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt's ridiculous how conference level -TV- contracts and 'pathway to the one and only national championship game' have become so powerful to supercede the fan support/excitement (and associated engagement) for regional conferences and local rivalries.\n\nThe old Big 12 was great and I really loved the old big 8 for how local it was-- Colorado, Nebraska, Iowa State, KSU, Kansas, Mizzou, OU and OSU. So many great roadtrips for away games, so many friendly rivalries, and winning the conference, and if not, at least going to a bowl game in a sunny location, was something that tons of fans enjoyed every year. All the attention on the 'national championship' has really taken away the more simple and widely shared/experienced pleasures of the post season, and the regular season is polluted with so many ridiculously far flung matchups. We will play West Virginia  and a Utah team like every year, but might schedule *one* our closest natural 'peer institutions' like OU, Neb, Mizzou, A/M, (etc) once a decade?",

When I lived in the Villages i got sick constantly cause of the mold problems and some of the other dorms have bat problems(a Google search will bring this up).

If your cat has an illness, he will be very open and fact based on costs, treatment options, likelihood for successes, etc. For routine check ups and vaccinations, he and his staff is very good with all of our cats different temperaments. And the clinic runs pretty efficiently and on time. I.E.  If your appointment is at 10, you won't be sitting in some room with your stressed out cat until 11 wondering if they forgot about you.

Being a RA/CM is really good as well- it\u2019s not cash pay but it\u2019s free housing and meal plan so the savings really add up. Athernton hotel pays around 11 an hour (for certain jobs, not sure if all) and serving / bartending can make you pretty good money as well. Agreed that it\u2019s frustrating how little the pay can be in Oklahoma- I worked multiple jobs in school until I got my serving job which helped ease my financial burden.",

Thus, we can rely only on the article. \n\n***Edit***: I see a line that says, \u201cLeaked Audio Of Stillwater City Manager\u201d, but it\u2019s not a link. If they update that line to be a link, someone please let me know.\n\nThere is exactly one place where the Leaked Audio is directly quoted:\n\n> Stillwater Mayor Will Joyce asked, \u201cDarryl when you say help your kid, what does that look like?\u201d Dougherty responded with \u201cThe PD [Stillwater Police Department] had a responsibility to look into the forms of abuse I presented. I believe they did him [minor child] a disservice when they refused to talk to me. I would like someone who is not mad at me to accept the evidence.\u201d\n\nThere\u2026 isn\u2019t much of interest here. This is Mayor Joyce asking Dougherty what his problem is, and Dougherty expressing his complaint and his desired resolution. The only spicy bit is Dougherty expressing that he believes the Stillwater PD has officers that are mad at him.\n\nI can understand keeping the word count down by avoiding excessive direct quotations. Attention spans are shrinking, and you need to get to the point\u2026 but why use *that* as your only Direct Quote? Especially considering your later summary of the leak\u2026 which is about halfway through the article.\n\n> In the over 1 hour audio of Stillwater Mayor Will Joyce, City Manager Norm McNickle, and a then Stillwater City Attorney the trio admitted to several acts of police misconduct and perjured testimony directly related to a pending appellate case at the Oklahoma State Supreme Court, as well as a pending civil tort lawsuit in the Payne County District Court.\n\nThat\u2019s *massive* if true. Representatives of the Defendants in a lawsuit sat down with the Plaintiff and *spent an hour confessing*. One of those representatives is a Lawyer, who could be subject to disbarment if he committed perjury or knowingly elicited it.\n\nIt would be nice if we had some direct quotes of those admissions, time-stamped links to the audio, or *literally anything more than the Writer\u2019s summary*.\n\nThe next paragraph is also *massive* **if** true:\n\n> At the end of the recording, Mayor Will Joyce is heard stating that no one would believe Mr. Dougherty, just minutes after admitting to the fraud committed by the Stillwater Police Department, once headed by McNickle.\n\nThat\u2019s some supervillain gloating, right there! \n\nThis is stuff straight from an episode of Matlock. You have a aggrieved father getting a private meeting with the people who hurt him and his child. You have an arrogant and evil mayor rubbing their smug superiority in that father\u2019s face, admitting to everything and then mocking him with a \u201cnobody will ever believe you.\u201d Then, to put the Cherry on top\u2026 it turns out that an as of yet unnamed fifth man in the room was secretly recording *everything*.\n\nIt\u2019s a perfect narrative\u2026 and that alone is reason to be highly suspicious.\n\nAny one of those admissions would be a *bombshell*\u2026 and yet the only direct quote is *incredibly boring*. The author is asking us to just trust him as he writes his summary, which reads like an episode summary from a Courtroom Drama, and he doesn\u2019t even offer up a quote.\n\nThis isn\u2019t quite \u201cHillary Clinton gives birth to Bat Baby,\u201d but I don\u2019t think I\u2019m inclined to treat it as more than a tabloid article unless the leaked audio is made available.",

Please make sure to treat the rooms nicely, as hundreds of others will use it in coming years. A big also - don\u2019t leave food or trash rotting in the dorms. One person doing that on a floor can cause a huge infestation for everyone on that floor. There are poor living situations all across Stillwater and often each unit is different. Alight, the Reserve, other big chain apartment complexes might look nice, but every unit is different. Even some of the local houses for rent aren\u2019t bad, but some are slum houses. It all comes down to the previous tenants and the landlord imho.

It\u2019s absolutely terrible if you can get a spot in the tiny lot attached to the building be careful about who you park by (nobody was ever parked straight and the spots are really narrow). If you can\u2019t park by the building there is a limited amount of street parallel parking and a gravel lot down the road. The gravel lot floods when it rains and snows and has no easy to drain so you just have to wait for it to dry up. Kids did donuts a lot so it was always muddy. Then the building itself is terrible. A lot of us thought that there were bats in the walls because we always heard like scratching and stuff. The AC sucks. If you can get someone to hack it you will have to do that. I swear it never got below 70 even when the thing on the wall said it was. The fire alarms went off almost 10 times( none of them being real fires) and we usually never got a full explanation as to why. One even went of during break when there were like 10 of us in the building. The lounges (at least on the west 2nd floor) were kind of gross and for like 1/3 of the year we only had one working washer. One would break every two weeks or so. Personally speaking, I had one conversation with my CM when I moved in and one when I moved out. He didn\u2019t really care for his job and pretended not to know me outside of the building. The walk to class sucks when it is rainy, snowy, or cold but especially when it\u2019s hot. On occasion the buses would not be running our route and we only found out through the group chat. There is so much wrong with this building.  On the bright side there is a convenient store downstairs and the mail come directly to the building:\u2019)",

But America stepping forward and actually becoming fully reliant on non-carbon energy sources? The largest economy on the planet?\n\nThat can start to have considerable work for influencing the incentives of more and more countries to start going green, and would give a whole country some serious clout in actual international efforts. Maybe after some time it would stop feeling like international climate change efforts are just a gaggle of alcoholics who constantly attend AA, but are still all drinking themselves to death on their own time.\n\nYeah, it would require serious work, and pretty shitty time frames because we're 40 years fucking late (thanks oil and energy companies, for knowing climate change was a problem and doing everything to stop progress), but I'm not gonna solve climate change by, like...donating to a fund or something. I'd maybe mitigate it by .00002%, but it won't matter if all that results in is \"I tried and watched everything go to hell anyway.\" The point isn't to be the voice of moral reason at the end lecturing everyone on how dumb they were because I actually picked up plastic on the beach, it's to actually fix the problem.\n\nIt **requires** government action, corporate won't do it, it has to start somewhere.\n\nAnd right now, the government isn't doing anything either because one party is subservient to the oil industry, or the other just doesn't really care enough to actually do anything when they had the chance.\n\nAnd part of being able to get the government to get off its ass would require a pretty strong consensus on the issue and not a \"debate\" between scientists and people like Ben Shapiro.",

Obviously from the general reply to this posting, there is plenty of racism of all types at least from the okstate reddit community.\n\nI truly wish you the best of luck at OSU or if even if you end up at another school. If you have any other questions about OSU or college feel free to DM me and I will try to help how I can.\n\n************\n\nYou are not irational to be concerned at all. I am not BIPOC, but this is based on what I have seen and on what I have heard from BIPOC students. I will also say that a lot of students and staff do their best to be antiracist and allies, but it's still a rural community.\n\nI'm sorry if this is a lot or intimidating, but I didn't want to just give you a sugary answer and say that OSU is perfect and that you won't see any racism. You almost definitely will see it or hear about it is some capacity, but there's more good than bad overall and hopefully you won't have to deal with it very often.\n\nTL;DR: OSU is about as racist as the rest of the region's cities, but will be better than rural areas. Look at OKStateStandUnited on Instagram for stories from other BIPOC students and their experiences. \n\nIn order not to sugarcoat it, I'll start with the bad.\nIf you are from Oklahoma or other rural areas, then I would say it's better than you might be used to. If you're from a larger city like Tulsa or some Texas cities, then it may be worse than your normal. The campus, while far more diverse than Oklahoma on average, is still extremely white. Many of the white students and staff will not have enough experience with BIPOC and be ignorant. I witnessed plenty of microagressions as a student from other students and probably committed plenty of my own without realizing.\n\nThere's not really explicit racism on campus because the school trys to preserve the image that there is no racism on campus at all, but stillwater is still very rural and very republican so it will be worse off of campus unless you are in one of the stores that are safe spaces. I moved out of Stillwater after graduating in May, but there were regularly Trump supporter convoys going up and down Perkins road and gathering in the parking lots of the outlet malls the last few years. These did seem to slow down or even stop at least during my last semester so they could be over with, but I don't know.\n\nNow for the good news.\nIf you're only looking in Oklahoma for schools, then between OU and OSU, I would always take OSU. Other out of state schools may be more progressive, but from mine and my partner's (who goes to OU) experience OSU in general is friendlier and more close-knit than OU and she has noticed more of both subtle and explicit racism there.\n\nThere are some terrific diversity-centered clubs and organizations on campus where you could find supportive people and allies. They are all fairly active on campus. Most clubs in general will also have nice and welcoming people who would be happy to have you. Club and organization fairs will be great to attend.\n\nThere are also plenty of staff and students who actively want to better themselves and make OSU more inclusive to diverse students. You can absolutely find people on campus who would be lifelong friends. There was a lot of people trying to do what they could to be supportive after George Floyd's murder and even some fairly large rallies and protests on campus. I would look up OKStateStandUnited on Instagram to see some stories and hear from actual BIPOC students.\n\nMany people who are ignorant and do something that offends you simply don't know any better and, while it's not your job or anyone else's to correct them and their behavior, they would probably be open to hearing that what they did was not ok and how to fix it.\n\nHopefully this is somewhat helpful to setting realistic expectations without scaring you.",

Back on topic, I want to say most everyone I\u2019ve known of varying backgrounds, beliefs, etc, seem to be very kind and accepting! However, I am white and essentially a local, so my viewpoint may very much be skewed. If you\u2019re looking for a perspective that would have much more experience, I would ask members in organizations such as Society of Professional Hispanic Engineers or National Society of Black Engineers. You can reach out to them on CampusLink! Also, they\u2019d be great places to just meet new people. Both organizations are actually quite diverse!\n\nThat being said, I think (and hope) you\u2019ll find a lot of good and kind people everywhere here. I consider myself and many of my fellow CEAT members to have that goal in mind, and know for certain there are plenty of other people across OSU like that. But again, if you want a thorough answer to quench any thoughts and to get connected with good people, reach out to those organizations!! I hope you get some great answers!!!",

        "body": "\"money grab by the administration\" -- Well, that isn't how it really works. Administration gets its cut of money from grants/contracts and tuition. Fees go to specific things that for student uses.\n\nAnd, what can be fees and what is included in tuition is dictated by the state legislature. A number of us faculty have pleaded to make fees rolled into tuition, because for our graduate students paid stipends on external grants and contracts, we can get their tuition paid for through the grants, but not fees. So our students get a fat bill for fees every semester which have to come out of their stipend checks. But, the state legislature dictates the separate accounting for things which have to be in the form of fees. Oklahoma isn't unique about this. Many state universities around the country charge 'fees' way in excess of 'tuition'. But it can be fixed. Just don't count on the state legislature here though to give a crap about it though, because they don't, but that is who to be mad at. And if you don't like how 'expensive' OSU is, that too, is mostly because the state of Oklahoma only supports about 7% of overall costs of OSU. That is down from 20% about 10 years ago, and 50% about 30 years ago. A lot of 'tax cuts' in Oklahoma that were enacted from 2000-2016 or so, were paid for by taking the money away from higher education. I think OK led the nation in defunding its support of state universities for this time period.\n\nAs for the fees, they all have specific earmarks and in every case it is something that the students use. Some of it subsidizes the athletics department so that students have cheap tickets to games (lame, I know, for how much support athletics get in donations, they should be able to support their own facilities). There is a fee that goes to support your son's free access to the gym on campus (highly recommend he use that). There is a fee that goes to student organizations and activities, which your son may be interested in joining. If you want your son to get his value in fees, have him go to student organizations and eat more than his share of free pizza around campus all semester  ('free', only because students fees paid for it). I don't know about Business, but in engineering, we also have fees for technology support which is somewhat high. That pot of money from those fees only supports technology investments that the students can then use in their lab classes and senior design projects. It's what pays for the new 3D printers, the remote control cars, the chemical reactors, and all the other equipment they use in various courses (and to add to the confusion, some courses have special lab fees, but the course specific lab fees usually only cover the direct consumables of the semester that the student uses, the technology fee is what updates and replaces the bigger equipment from time to time). There is also a fee in engineering to help pay for the new undergraduate laboratory building. It's a nice facility, but I wish we got more money from donors to build it, so that student fees didn't have to make up that big of a difference (to clarify, donors DID pay for most of that building, thanks to hard work by administrators to fund raise for it).\n\nOh, and many fees are directly controlled by student organizations -- It's a committee of students that decides how to split the student activity funds every semester, students have an important part of the input in how technology fees are spent each year, etc. And, most fees were directly assessed by university student government, or at the very least, 'blessed' by student government.",

And federal granting agencies dictate that tuition can be waived/covered through grants, but fees can't (because fees directly support student activities). And waiving fees for even student employees on teaching jobs has legal issues with the state government, because state money can't be used for individual 'benefit'. So, the Colvin center fee, which benefits you, can't be covered by a state dollar. (yeah, I know, lame, but that is the situation. Same rules mean OSU won't cover my professional society dues, even though in the private sector the employer ALWAYS pays for such things).\n\nThe faculty here (me included) have made a plea several times to push towards changing our accounting so that we can get fees rolled into tuition so that it can be waived for the graduate students.  But they can't do it due to the state legislature, and the state legislature doesn't care about student debt.\n\nWhat sucks about being an institution that the state only pays 7% of (maybe lower now), is that they get to dictate 100% of our accounting practices.",

We ask you please reach out to your elected officials to voice your support of women's rights and participate in organized protest if you are able to do so. Also please remember to go vote in the Oklahoma Primary on June 28th and the General Election on November 8th.\n\n*edit* i guess its really hard to understand that i just copy/pasted because people said they couldn't see it on mobile. although women should have the right to choose and have bodily autonomy. fuck the patriarchy.",

Some people have had issues (primarily bug related) in the Hester & 213 location. I had an issue where there was beeping from an alarm from their utility closet that took a call from the fire marshal to get it to stop. That was the only main issue we had and no issues with any bugs and only needed maintenance for very minor things.

My super basic knowledge about it is that it depends on what your scholarships and aid says it covers, for example if it only covers tuition or some fees etc, then there is a limit but otherwise if it\u2019s just an amount of money it can apply to your bill as needed. I assume that if you have more aid than charges or only aid that pays for tuition and fees but not housing they will have to make some adjustments and I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll get like a check back or anything. Also please keep in mind that we have lots of students and lots of aid and summer is one of the busiest times for their office so it may take a few days to get back to you.

        "body": "Hey there, first thing I'll say is that you're already doing great for looking at schools and asking these questions. \n\nI accidentally wrote a novel so I am sorry about that. TL;DR: OSU is a great place to come to school, and you would probably like it here. The program,faculty, connections, and nearby food are all good if not great. Look at the numbered list at the bottom for general tips. feel free to ask any other questions. You're gonna be just fine no matter where you end up going to school. \n\nI will also say that I don't know much about the transfer process, but have had a few friends who were transfer students and never had any complaints about how it worked for them. I only came to OSU with six hours that transferred with no issues. I know there is a website where you can check for individual course equivalencies. to make sure that each class will fill a spot on the degree requirements.  If you haven't already looked at this page on the OSU website, then I would give it a quick read: [OSU Transfer Student Information Page](https://go.okstate.edu/admissions/transfer/index.html)\n\nI am graduating at the end of this semester with my Bachelor's of Science from the psychology program, so I can say a bit more about that subject specifically. I personally have enjoyed a vast majority of my time in the program and could probably give you a few class recommendations if you'd like them. Almost every professor I've had, has been wonderful. They are very passionate about the subject and genuinely care about student well-being and learning. Like every subject and department, though there are always the terrible professors that you can't completely avoid.\n\nI cannot say in the grand scheme of things where OSU's psychology program ranks, but assuming you're from Oklahoma and would prefer to stay close, I know that it isn't any better than OU's program because my partner's sister got her undergrad in psychology from OU a few years back. Unless you are interested in going out of state, then I think OSU is a great choice. I cant say how much more difficult transferring will make getting through the program, but I don't feel like it could make that large of a difference from what I have seen. If you are willing to, emailing one of the advisors in the program, would probably help put you at ease. They will be pretty busy until the end of the semester but are usually very good at getting back to you if you have questions. On that note as well, my advisor has been terrific at helping me with any possible problem I have had, and I have to assume any other Psych advisors would be just as good.\n\nAs for job opportunities and connections, I have always felt like the program is very helpful in this regard. If you are interested in research then I get position posters for different research positions pretty constantly from the advisors and in classes. If you can get a research position under one of the faculty, then I have also heard great things about that, and the professors would make great mentors or references. \n\nFor Clinical psych master's and doctorate programs, specifically, there is the Psychological Services Center (PSC) where you will work under supervision with students and other community members who come in seeking treatment. It seemed like a great position from my perspective when I was a receiving therapy from them. I have also heard exclusively good things about the director of the PSC who you would work under. I am also taking a class with him this semester and have loved it.\n\nThe only out of state schools I have heard any significantly good things about are TCU having a pretty good psych program and TU Austin being the generally best Texas school. As a private christian school, TCU will be far more expensive and I can't say how you would feel at a christian school. TU is also very far away and would be more expensive with out of state tuition. I personally haven't looked much into other schools in other states. If you want to get out of Oklahoma then more power to you, I'm getting out of here as soon as I can personally.\n\nIn regards to campus food, it's always been pretty decent to me. I think they have lost a few options lately, but its still good. Where you live/attend classes will greatly impact what you eat though as the options are spread all over campus. I'm going to assume you're not going to stay in the dorms. I don't think you have to as a transfer student with so many credits, and I would not really recommend living on campus if you have the choice. There's not really too much that's that bad, but its pretty expensive when compared to renting somewhere, and there's less privacy and amenities. If you really want to live on campus, then you would probably be fine though as long as your roommate(s) are bearable. If none of the food on campus is that appealing to you, then there are plenty of options off campus and you could always pack a lunchbox for the days you don't have time to leave and come back.\n\nIn general, I can give a few things I wish I'd known.\n\n1. Try and look at websites like RateMyProfessor before enrolling each semester (take it with a grain of salt though because ratings tend to skew more negative than they actually should be , but will give you a good idea of what to expect). You could also ask any classmates you get along with about what classes they have enjoyed.\n2. Never hesitate to email a professor or advisor with issues. More often than not, they really want you to succeed and will work with you as much as they can.\n3. You can probably trust your gut in the first week or two about how you feel you might do in a class. If you are worried about something you can ask the professor or if there is anything major that you know will be an issue, I would drop before the full refund deadline and find a different class to fill its spot. I have had to drop so many classes with a W grade because I overestimated what I could personally handle. This isn't to say to run at the first sign of rain, just that you know yourself and how you learn.\n4. Make sure, if you don't already do this, that you have your email saved to your phone and to download Canvas (The online portal for OSU if you didn't know). I also cannot recommend a digital calendar enough. You can connect Canvas to one and it will populate your schedule automatically. If you don't know how to do this I or many others could show you.\n5. If you are like me, and are not very active or in shape, then A bike is another good addition. it makes getting around much faster, easier, and less tiring.\n6. If you know what type of setting you learn best in, I would try to find a spot on campus that works for you and try to consistently work there. i can give some recommendations for this as well.\n7. Try to find a few consistent activities outside of classes if you are comfortable doing so, but don't overdo it. Id recommend maybe one to three clubs or extracurriculars to start out and see how it feels. I wouldn't do more than four no matter what. I don't think it would be possible for anyone to really get into all of them and keep up with school full time. Again though, you know yourself better than I do.\n8. If you don't know a lot of people coming here with you, then try to talk to people in class and make friends. I met my best friends my freshman year here.\n\nI'm sorry again that this is such a long reply. I just got excited when you said you were a psychology student and wanted to be really thorough. If you have any other questions, feel free to DM me and I will try to answer them. Hope you have a good senior year either way and good luck!",

You'll get your credits (most or all, depending on where your credit is from), but unless they changed procedure and protocol  for scholarships and living on-campus, you'll be considered a freshman when it comes to initial enrollment due to your high school graduation date. In terms of potential scholarships, it opens you up to more potential pools of money. It does not necessarily mean it'll take you 4 years to finish. Just an initial classification. You'll send them your transcripts and your advisers will work with them and you to pick up where you need to be.\n\nHonestly the biggest piece of advice is to visit campus, take the tour, and try to talk with someone in the psychology department or the college of arts and sciences to see what it's like and what the transition will look like.

I can tell you attending OSU was the best decision I ever made. The psychology classes are not big which helps when building connections with professors. They are the reason I chose to go into Clinical Psychology, because I learned so much about opportunities in the field (not just teaching). I will be honest, my advisor was awful but building relationships with the professors made up for it. I was not a transfer student but I can tell you the student population is very friendly and making friends is not difficult because of all of the student organizations, intramural sports, and especially the dorm life. My best friends to this day are the people I met in my dorm. We've been in each others weddings, made lots of memories, and it made OSU feel like home. The food on campus is awesome, especially in the commons (dorms). My sister goes there and I was able to join her for lunch- it's better than cafeteria food. I recommend attending the junior or senior weekend which is like an orientation for prospective students. You will learn a lot about OSU and get to meet friends while exploring the campus. Plus if you need anything, our alumni base can help with anything- a lot of us have family members attending or know people at the school that can help you get accustomed to Stillwater and OSU.

That being said I rented from three different places during my time in stillwater and while they weren't terrible there were a ton of issues ranging from small inconveniences to straight up trying to steal deposits for absolute bs. Mostly shady, shitty practices involving deposits and cleaning and maintenance. That was pretty much the case with everyone I knew no matter where they stayed. Not trying to be discouraging but I never heard of any of the large company owned apartments/duplexes that weren't at least somewhat predatory in deposits and shitty maintenance/upkeep. Really a game of finding the lesser of the evils. If you don't mind rooming with someone there are some small time guys who own 5-15 actual houses with garages and fenced in yards they rent out that are nice and usually less predatory but they also usually run $1000-1300/ month before utilities/internet so might need to find a roommate or 2 to make it work. The best place we stayed we found on zillow from a nice guy who owned like 7-8 houses. He was pretty chill but still took too much out of the deposit for some bogus stuff. Good luck is what I'm trying to say lol.",

It never hurts to ask, and a lot of times they will go out of their way for you if you make the effort to email and call.\n\nHowever, instead of emailing or calling the graduate admissions office directly, I would email or call the department head for the forensic science program, the graduate advisor for that program, or both in the same email. While the graduate college makes the general admissions decisions, it is the individual department and their graduate committee that you are apply to that makes the big decisions. If they are interested enough in you (especially if you show the interest and effort by emailing or calling), the department will be more likely to make an exception. The graduate admissions office is really just handled broad issues (did you fill out the proper paperwork, does your application look complete and legit, etc.) while the department handles the specific things like if they think your previous work is relevant or not to their program. \n\nAlso, sadly a lot of people will be in and out of the office this coming week since it is spring break, so don't be discouraged if you don't get a response until the following week.",

I don't know how this is set up gender wise anymore, but the current floor plan shows a mens bathroom on the east end and womens bathroom on the west end. (I have access to the floor map). So, not sure what bathroom you are using, but that might matter more.\n\nI lived there for two consecutive years (awhile back, I think rooms 207 and 219) and always used the stairwell on the east end of the building.\n\nRoom X15 (I think) is what I would pick if I was a student nowadays if I was living alone -- the room behind the stairwell on the east wall with a central window. The quietest rooms in these old dorm buildings are usually the endcaps. And they are close to stairs and bathrooms.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, imagine a rectangle of rooms. In the center (going west to east) is the west stairwell, women's restroom, elevators, mechanical room, common area room, mens restrooms, and east stairwell. The room numbers go as follows:\n\n(going clockwise from the NW corner)\n\nThe rooms start at the NW corner with room X01 (windows facing north). Going left to right (east to west),\n\n\\--X04 is nearest the north women's restroom door\n\n\\-- X05 is right off the elevator lobby (great if you are super social, terrible if you are not)\n\n\\--X08 is right across the northside entry to the common room\n\n\\--  X10 is right across the north door of the mens restroom\n\n\\-- X12 is probably closest to the east stairwell door and the east door of the men's restroom\n\n\\--  X14 is the NE corner.\n\n\\-- X15 is the east end room with a central window behind the east stairwell.\n\n\\--X16 is the SE corner (windows facing south), and now going back left to right (east to west),\n\n\\--X20 is across the south door to the men's restroom.\n\n\\--X22 is the floor residential assistant (and near the other common room south door)\n\n\\--X25 is right off the elevator lobby (opposite of X05)\n\n\\--X26 is nearest the south door to the women's restroom\n\n\\--X28 is nearest the door the west side stairwell and the west door of the womans' restroom\n\n\\--X29 is the SW corner, and\n\n\\-- X30 is the West endcap with a window in the middle.\n\nHope that helps, but whatever room you get will be great:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTidbit --  in Kerr and Drummond and Wentz, the east end cap rooms were highly prized because of the gorgeous views towards campus. Only super seniors still living in the dorms got them, but after 9-11, nobody wanted rooms 911 which was the east cap rooms in Kerr and Drummond and Went!  Well, my (now wife) happily snagged Drummond 911 and one of my best friends got Wentz 911.",

The basement is also a very nice study area full of white boards and has a study room.",

I definitely agree with the east stairwell being a great asset for the 2-4 floors. The elevators have a habit of going out and are generally slower than just taking the stairs, with the east one being closer to your classes. I think X11-15 are all pretty solid picks. I\u2019d go with the second or third floor, if possible.",

        "body": "I currently live in Broken Arrow and take the BOB 3 times a week. M,W,F. The schedule has been reduced this semester due to shortage of drivers. Luckily my class Schedule works for me. Here is a [**link**](https://tulsa.okstate.edu/bob/schedules) to the Bob's current schedule.  I usually take the 5:30am or 7:00 am bus. As you would expect the 5:30am bus is kind of empty, today in the morning there were only 5 of us. I like to return to Tulsa on the 5:40pm bus b/c the 4:30 tends to be too full and I'd rather stick around an extra hour and get more homework done \\[or browse reddit \\] instead of being on a full bus. I drive a small VW GTI hatchback and it's still cheaper for me to ride the bus since I don't pay for gas and the tolls roundtrip.\n\nFrom my experience:\n\n* A one way ticket cost $7.50, so $15.00 Round trip\n* You reserve trips before you get on the bus on the same [link](https://shuttle.okstate.edu) I posted. It has to be reserved at least 15 minutes before the bus leaves. You can also reserve an entire semesters worth of trips at a time. I never do this b/c sometimes class gets cancelled due to weather, etc...\n* You can pay for the bus with Credit Card, Debit, or charge to your bursar.\n* If you reserve a spot, and do not get on the bus, you cannot get a refund but they will change your ticket for another date or time to the same destination. So if you miss your trip from STW to Tulsa then you can only change the date or time for the same point A to point B.\n* Personally I have never been hot on the bus, at least not to the point of fainting or needing a cup of water to feel better. I guess it depends on how easily you get hot. I will add that I have only been taking the BOB for 3 years so maybe I got lucky with the bus I am getting on.\n* The wifi on the bus never works. I use my phone and connect to it as a hotspot.\n* If you ride the bus and it's dark the lights are turned off so it's hard to get work done. I just nap.\n* Due to COVID you are expected to wear a mask. Most of us do but there are a couple people who don't. Even on a packed bus you can count them with one hand so it's not bad.\n* It's a shuttle bus so it is more comfortable than a school bus but not very roomy. I would also compare the space and comfort of the seats to be better than most public transportation but about as uncomfortable as an airplane seat. Nothing to write home about.\n* When you park your car at the OSU-Tulsa campus, the parking lots are patrolled all day and there are officers on site on campus. I've never had anything happen to my car.\n\nFinally, I would say that the BOB bus is not perfect but it's good enough if it works with your schedule. I never would have been able to attend OSU in Stillwater without the BOB. I didn't have the option to move.",

When my wife attended full time it was more economical for her to live in Stillwater but when she went to part time and only needed to commute two or three times a week. It was cheaper to take BOB (that\u2019s what they are called Big Orange Bus.). The advice I\u2019d give (from what I remember from what she said) is to always take a water bottle (with ice in the summertime) and sometimes a personal fan because it was a little warm. \nHopefully the booking has gotten better, this was right before the \u2018rona shut the world down, but they were a little difficult to cancel or move a reservation and refunds were almost impossible.  She had to call to get some things done and they weren\u2019t open for some of her trips. She wasn\u2019t the earliest but it was right before they opened.  \nAnother piece of advice would be to reserve your trip instead of trying the standby.

I had a class at 8am and the first bus that would leave Tulsa so that I could make it in time was at 5am, I believe. This was back in 2019 tho. \n\nI thought it was fine, but it DOES get MAD full if you reserve rides at 8am! I'm not sure what it was like during COVID or if anything has changed... but I thought it was worth it! Just arrive on time, lock your car, and make sure you also have a ride booked back!!",

        "body": "TLDR: You'll most likely make friends and get a good head start on other freshmen, but you'll have to deal with a very meh dorm situation.\n\nDisclaimer: I changed out of CEAT after finishing my first year for many reasons and I participated in the bridge program and lived in Parker the first year after the remodel from Fall of 2017 to Spring of 2018 so I don't know what changes have been made since my time there.\n\nThat said, I generally enjoyed the experience. I felt like the bridge program really helped transition into college more smoothly than had I not done it. \n\nThe pros, in my opinion, are:\nIt's great for meeting the people in your cohort if you want to make friends like the previous comment said.\nIt also helped to meet some of the professors you'll have down the line and get a small sample of their vibes and get your name and face in their minds. \nThe common spaces on each floor were great for hanging out and meeting people or studying together more casually.\nThe PEATEs we're pretty helpful as CEAT specific mentors.\nThe basement study area was really nice (but there are also two buildings on campus that specifically for CEAT majors to study in or  the entire library, or any other random spot you would enjoy studying at)\nThe industry tours were pretty interesting.\n\nThe cons:\nTraditional style dorms are terrible unless you get a roommate that you mesh well with. I was lucky enough but there were a LOT of horror stories that came from my cohort. (If traditional style is what you want/are comfortable paying for, or the pros outweigh this, then the point is moot.) \nThe bridge program was pretty expensive.\nBridge was exhausting because they keep you busy from 8AM to 11PM.\nThe laundry space is small and can get really backed up.\nVery small kitchen so cooking will also be difficult.\nBathrooms were terrible. 6 showers and 8 stalls per floor split with 60ish people was not fun to deal with.\n\nThere's a lot of things in both lists that I'm forgetting, but over all, it will really depend on what you want. If you are sure one of the CEAT majors is what you want, then it's a great experience and you'll get a great head start. If you have already taken at least calculus and are a decent writer, then you won't gain much from the classes during bridge, but it's mainly to get out of taking the first year seminar and make friends anyway. If your not sure, it will probably help you decide very quickly. I knew of at least 3 people who changed out of CEAT before bridge even ended and many many more during the first year. Either way it helps get used to college and OSU's campus.\n\nIf you have any other specific questions about Parker and bridge, or generaL questions about college/OSU feel free to DM me. Good luck.",

You may not like his play calling (even though the same shit you complain about has been happening for a decade under Gundy), and you may hold a grudge against him for the championship game (debatable, but fair), but he brings a mentality and attitude that fosters the kind of culture we all want in a football program: do your part on and off the field. Why would you call for someone\u2019s job when this kind of attitude absolutely gave coaches like Gundy and Boynton the platforms they needed to develop their respective programs. Absolute caveman behavior coming from some of y\u2019all. Chill tfo\n\nEdit: just to clarify, this is not in any way directed at OP!",

That's probably the biggest plus - I'm not sure if something similar could be achieved with one of the local 141 flight schools (not even sure what's available at stillwater), but it'd be something to look into. Maybe a minor in aviation with a major elsewhere? Not sure if that's possible - best bet is to honestly reach out to the flight department and ask.\n\nAs for costs, when I went to flight school 10 years ago,  FAFSA only covered tuition and didn't factor in flight training. Not sure if that's changed, but at least the way it used to be, your financial aid award vs your major wouldn't change, and financial aid wouldnt exceed tuition costs.\n\nWhat I can say, is I'm someone who started with flight training, and then ran out of money and had to pivot to mtx. Ive been able to move up and now work out of corporate so I can't complain, but I wouldnt have student loans if I didn't do flight training. Be honest with yourself, and your financial situation. As you said, flight training isn't cheap, and it sucks to spend a small fortune, only to not finish everything.\n\nBest of luck!",

Trippet does an awesome job of taking really old philosophies and applying them to ethical dilemmas/morality issues that are prevalent today.

I find that a lot of people who don\u2019t like philosophy usually think philosophy is boring/pointless/old but being able to connect philosophy to one\u2019s daily life can help build a passion for the topic (that\u2019s what happened to me!).",

The majority of fraternities aren\u2019t \u201cinsane\u201d at partying. The majority of fraternity\u2019s party but you won\u2019t really find many that throw party\u2019s every Thursday Friday Saturday like it sounds like you would assume. AGR here is very ag centered and FarmHouse is very academic and doesn\u2019t really party at all, I\u2019ve never heard of them throwing a party much since I\u2019ve been here. If you are serious about coming here and serious about Greek life and this is an option for you, I would look into Greek Discovery Day where students can come down late in the spring and it\u2019s kind of the intro to recruitment where you meet every house, other kids rushing, and get a house tour from the fraternities. Recruitment here for fraternities is very different from other schools in that it\u2019s informal and happens during the summer instead of the first week of school like basically everywhere else. Also freshmen live in the fraternities houses and not in dorms (I think we are 1 of 2 big schools in the nation to do this). gogreek.OKState.edu has a lot of info on Greek life. Also you can DM if you have more questions, I\u2019m a senior and am very involved in Greek life.",

As fara as off campus there is the Strip, a road of bars right next to campus, there is tumbleweed on the outskirts of town, and there is plenty of restaurants to go to. Going to the 24 hour Whataburger with your friends is a lot of fun and is its own event. I lived in Stout Hall, which reportedly has a more active community, so that does bias some of my perspective, but based on myself and what I saw, my advice is to get involved in clubs, make a good group of friends, and do your homework, and you'll find your time is plenty occupied on weekends.\n\nActually, if your involved and spend time with your friends, you might need any dead time you can get!",

The non-alum with no ties there literally support OU because they were once upon a time a college powerhouse, and it seems a bit desperate and pathetic to be that emotionally invested in a college team for which you have no connection.\n\nOf course, pro level is different. You can't really have ties to those teams outside of region or liking their colors, so it makes sense; especially since pro sports is unequivocally entertainment. But to see the many toothless, uneducated, backwoods rednecks ready to hoot and hollar in someone's face about how great \"they\" (lumping themselves in with an academic institution) are, is just a bit beyond grating.\n\nTo be fair though, I think it is pretty ridiculous to care much for any college team unless you grew up in the town, attended the school, or have somewhat immediate family who attended.\n\nAlso, equally as grating, is the fact that OU fans (alum or not) don't seem to be able to grasp the concept that they are supposed to win. That team has been riding the high of its old glory days since the 80s, when OSU was a tiny farm school. Beyond that, Norman is a suburb of a a metropolitan city. They have ALWAYS had the edge in recruiting. They are fielding teams of 4 and 5 star recruits while OSU is lucky to get a couple. OU should win. Every year. By a lot! That is what makes it so entertaining when they don't, and even more so when the little farm school on the prairie is the one that takes their season from them. OSU is a school and a team built on culture and growth. We take overlooked, discarded talent and build formidable teams year after year for the last decade. OU constantly has a top 10-20 recruiting class and their highest achievement year in and out is winning the Big 12. \n\nCelebrate your team, enjoy your wins; but also understand context. You beating OSU is the way things are supposed to go. It's cool and all for you, but not overly impressive. Yet, that doesn't stop the toothless sooners from acting like they just won the National Championship each time they do.",

We get to play a great team in a nice location on New Year.\n\n I hate how college football has become too narrowly focused on the national championship game, especially with the four team playoff chosen by a committee (Wtf!?). For decades, fans were happy celebrating great seasons with bowl games against teams they hardly ever (if ever) play. Afterwards a few teams declared themselves 'national championships' that year based on whatever poll or ranking system they wanted, and we just moved forward. \n\nIt was sad seeing how many really good teams had half-empty stadiums a couple of weeks ago when the fans decided it wasn't worth watching that last game since their team was out of playoff contention. For eff's sake, games are fun, football is a sport. It's a big pie out there full of rewards and it's not winner take all.",

That OU was not going to have any problem making the transition. OU is now definitely wounded; I'm sure the AD and President threw a ton of money at Bob Stoops to do what he could to stem the tide.  They lost what, half the coaching staff to USC? And then there are the current players and future commits that are bailing on the program. A bowl game they'll supposedly play in, probably the Alamo, last I had heard - how appropriate! What a change in the last week or two.\n\nFirst time since 1947 that an OU coach left to go to another program. Lincoln never hinted to the AD or President that he was considering leaving. They were expecting to start negotiating a new contract with him, likely for more money. He could have told them he was considering USC/LSU/etc and they'd have given him the moon to keep him. Instead he chose to do to OU what OU had done to the Big 12.\n\nImagine being a potential replacement. Wouldn't that make you wonder about the culture at OU? Because I sure would.",

ESPN even ran an article last week about how a 10-2 Bama team (the second lost to Georgia) still deserves to be in the playoffs if the committee is \"serious\" about putting in the \"best 4 teams in the country\". If Alabama wins, there will definitely be two SEC teams in and we are going to be out. If Alabama pays competitively but loses, we still may be out. And no matter what, if we have a tough game but still win, they will do what they can to keep us out.\n\nWe need to win our game convincingly -and- either hope Alabama gets womped bad, or for something to happen to Cinci or Michigan.\n\nI've seen this happen for like all of the last decade. SEC goes into the season with like 7 ranked teams (or more) and they start conference play right away. Any early SEC-other conference matchup will for sure up the ranking of that opponent as well. So, teams like Bama play teams that are ranked *when they play,* and nobody looks to see how many of those teams end up being 6-6 or worse at the end of the year.  And, the 4 OOC games the SEC schedules are often the worse of the worse teams, all to pad their offensive and defensive stats. Then, 'by the eye test', they are declared the best. \n\nE$PN has killed college football.",

We lost to Iowa State - who was not the power then that they are now (the similarities to 2011 though are kind of eerie).\n\nIt was directly a result of that injustice that we have the current playoff system.\n\nI would agree though that letting sportswriters decide who gets to compete in the playoff is a joke.

It was deliberate and calculative.\n\nAnd the pundits at ESPN by and large *then* came up with all sorts of excuses about how Bama still deserved it. Instead of talking about who you beat, where OSU had a clearly superior record  (Bama only had like 3 wins against ranked opponents -- or was it only 3 wins against opponents with winning records), they turned the tables and focused on the losses.\n\nIt was very strange because never before that did the losses mean more than the wins. Better to play 11 cupcakes and lose to a good team than to beat 11 good teams and lose to a cupcake (on the road, in overtime)",

I mean, I get why they're joining (re:$$$), but Bedlam is apparently a sacrifice they're willing to make. Definitely not the first rivalry in college athletics that'll die due to conference realignment. \n\nShrum's non-committal answer about extending the series in all sports tells me it's not happening any time soon. Gundy isn't convinced it'll continue after they bolt, either. \n\nIf this is the last time Bedlam football is played in awhile (assuming they both leave before next Fall), then it could not have ended any sweeter. Sooner fans complaining about referees (per usual when they lose their one or two games a year) and thumping their chest about the SEC while watching OSU and Baylor in the Championship? Beautiful.

Besides that the noodles are very weak, I\u2019m pretty sure they\u2019re instant ramen noodles and they clump together and don\u2019t hold the flavor of the broth. The kicker for me is the non braised egg in the ramen bowl. They just throw in a half of soft boiled egg that isn\u2019t braised in soy sauce. IMO that\u2019s just lazy as all good ramen places have braised eggs. I will say the chachu is really good, it tastes great and they give you two slices.

Since it's aimed at science writers, I think you could make the argument that its not really automating \"education\" since scientific publications often tend to be written about already done lab work and experiments - this is a later stage step seeking to lessen some of the, at times, arbitrary barriers to publication. Anecdotally, I've seen plenty of faculty who have complained that students of all levels can't write as well as they used to. I imagine this intends to speed up the learning curve, as I've also heard (stem) faculty say once you get a few papers out, it's just repeating the process later on.

We don't really need new tech and gadgets to fix the problems with education, we need education reforms and restructuring, and a return to a much more personal method of educating students. While this gets funded, tons of faculty are underpaid and losing their jobs. It's just a disparity. In a perfect world, fund this--fund everything!

This is something an advisor or PI should work on with their grad students, but that's not equal across the board.\n\nI don't know if this program is an ideal solution (or even a good one), but I imagine it also exists to help some faculty who already feel spread too thin. I dunno. I'm trying to make an effort to be more of an optimist, which hard to be with some parts of higher ed. At least this is an external grant and not some redirected state funding that could go to existing campus or academic programs.\n\nI'm curious how much the Writing Center or Campus Writing Program hosts programs to help with this as well.

The same people claiming they are being oppressed by this are the ones that are always saying an employer should be able to hire/fire for any reason (until it affects them). \n\nVaccines DRASTICALLY reduce both infections and hospitalization. That's absolute fact. And if more people had been vaccinated when they were first available, we probably wouldn't need a mandate because this thing would be dwindled down substantially by now. \n\nYou are not losing rights, unless you think you have a \"right\" to endanger your entire community. But frankly, I'm fine with you losing that \"right\". There are already court decisions that state vaccine mandates are entirely constitutional, so I have no idea why people think they are somehow losing rights.",

I\u2019ve met more people that hate watching sanders and want another qb, and my answer is illingworth only because I\u2019ve seen him do really good. I\u2019m definitely not saying he\u2019s the best, but I think getting him and the others some play time to develop them rather than watching Spencer fail time and time again would not be a bad plan",

Weirdly enough you\u2019d probably like College Bar better if you\u2019re looking for a good place to drink with a good vibe. Bit of a Hole in the wall but a staple for a lot of college kids. Order a PHD, breakfast shot, or the one with dry ice. Willies for ice shots, Outlaws for dancing (we country Western here, something you\u2019ve probably never seen being from Wisconsin, not much social country western dancing outside OK/TX). Tumbleweed on a Friday is another place to experience that. I know George\u2019s Stables has a loyal following as well. \n\nEskimo Joes is our tourist trap food place, I would skip the wait and hit something along Main Street or Washington (the \u201cstrip\u201d with most of the bars). Garage is a great option down the street from Joes but will likely have a similar wait. \n\nTailgates are always fun to see and our football players all walk down Hester Street from the Atherton to the stadium along with a short parade around 3:58 PM. Keep an eye out for our paddle people during the game as well as our pony BB and horse Bullet. There\u2019s a block party near the stadium that is mostly meant for families to my understanding but if you want to sort of see what all is offered I would check it out. It\u2019s on the side of the stadium near the outdoor and indoor practice fields. \n\nPro tip: if you want to see the players up close in person, wait for them to come out after the game, you\u2019ll see a crowd of friends and family waiting to pick them up. I got to introduce a really happy fan to a starter I know last game and it was great to see the smile on her face. Have also seen players sign kids footballs and it\u2019s great to see how much joy the kid and player both get out of it. \n\nPeople here are friendly don\u2019t be afraid to talk to a stranger. \n\nIt\u2019s 10:56 PM in Stillwater and OU still sucks",

As in many other things, this is another where Stillwater falls short in the quality-of-life department. I've been in dozens of towns of 10,000 people that have a true billiards hall (for all ages). Nearly any college town will have one too, since for pete's sake, a lot of college kids aren't 21 yet and want places to go.  But Stillwater? Nope.

He doesn't do a good job building our brand, he makes a lot of questionable coaching decisions on the field, and nowadays he is making way too much for what he is bringing to the table. He is too comfortable shooting for good enough.\n2. College football needs to stop obsessing about national titles.     That game is rigged. Only a subset of universities are going to be allowed into that, even if they expand the playoff they will do so in the way to maximize the number of the golden child teams and minimize the opportunities for schools like ours to make it in. If your team was terrible in the 1970s, you can't be in the club. The boomers and older genXers that run the mood at ESPN won't let go of their own 'glory years'.  Also, the national championship for college football didn't used to be the goal. The goal of a good season was maybe winning your conference and getting invited into a bowl game in a sunny location where the fans and players can party at New Years. This focus on the national championship is a 20 year project by ESPN and SEConCBS to expand the audience for more viewership and dollars to include all the lay people who watched football primarily on Sundays. There are 120 something football teams. You are only in college for 4 years. You may be an alumnus that keeps watching for another 40 years. National championships in a league with 120+ teams means that 98%+ of teams are set up to be viewed as failures every decade just based on the statistics. To me, college football isn't even fun to watch anymore. Teams are playing teams that are thousands of miles away within the same conference, and outside the conference, to prove that they are 'worthy' of being 'chosen' to play for a championship. A single loss by any team is an automatic end to the season (except those within the 10-20 'chosen', they could lose 2 games and still be hyped into the playoff). College football used to be fun. It used to be about beating your in state and adjacent state rivals, or at least playing them well enough to make the game fun to watch. It used to be about getting a 8+ wins season so that you can consider road-tripping to that bowl game and having a party. You cared about the conference title, but you didn't have to give 2 shts about the other conferences and who in the top 25 loss so that you can squeeze up the rankings. At the end of the year, the media and other outlets declared rather flippantly 1-3 national championships of teams that went undefeated and then looked forward to the next Fall.",

        "body": "It's kind like what happened to Uber and ride share companies.\n\nThese businesses that rely on contract 'employees' are supported in the Billions of dollars by Wall Street money to get going. The first phase is to get into every market available, taking heavy losses in exchange for market share. With Uber and lyft, riders had amazingly low prices, with Grubhub the fees to restaurants were minimal and so places sign up.\n\nBut reality must hit. In the second phase, these companies have to start finding a way to become profitable. That means raising rates and squeezing pay to the contract 'employees'. It has to happen. Where at one time, an Uber was often half the cost of a taxi, now, they are mostly equivalent around the country (in many cities, an Uber is nearly always more expensive, and riders are supposed to accept that for the 'convenience' of the app). Uber tries to really capitalize on a model where they can profit and reward otherwise underpaid drivers on 'surge' pricing, especially after sporting and music events where a large number of customers are seeking a ride late at night when public transit stops (or is limited) and they are otherwise stranded far from home. There are a lot of academic articles out there about what phase three will look like for Uber -- quite possible it slowly declines until a collapse as riders bulk at high prices, drivers find jobs elsewhere that actually pay something (after wear and tear, it is nearly impossible for Uber drivers to realize meaningful pay). Maybe it finds profitability just enough in select markets to exist in some limited form. But, I have seen few experts outside the hysterics of Wall Street and ~~Silicon~~ 'App' valley truly believe that there is some magic left to be discovered to realize enough profits to reward shareholders. At the end of the day, is an 'app' that connects starving drivers to riders too scared of public transit and 'dirty taxis' really innovative enough to churn out the billions needed to pay off the investors? \n\nGrubhub is finally hitting that second phase. They are trying to be profitable now.  Last year, they have tried and still had a loss of 156 million dollars (during the pandemic!!). So they raise rates on restaurants, on consumers, and squeeze the drivers as much as possible to try to turn a profit. This will probably fail harder than the ride-share phase though. How much extra are customers willing to see on their end in grubhub pricing? How drunk or high must the customer be to accept paying up to double to cost of picking up the food directly from the restuarant (literally, between 'tip' and Grubhub fees, I've seen the menu price of the food literally double by the time you get to the confirm order screen in Miami and Seattle and other markets like that! Even here in Stillwater, the fees are creeping). On the restaurant side, are they -needing- the grubhub business where they are paying large fees on every order when most people in a town like Stillwater can easily enough just call and make a pick up order? I have my doubts, as do many who study these systems. \n\nBottom line is this -- There are a -lot- of costs and inefficiencies associated with having individual contract employees pick up orders and bring them to people's addresses. A lot of restaurants don't deliver, and those that do usually have food that is low cost to produce (pizza) and they work hard at optimizing efficiencies of the operation and limiting the range they are willing to deliver. In many cities, delivery is limited to only \\~2 miles of individual locations. There is nothing unique about a grubhub app that can break through all of those problems and pay off hungry investors looking for 20-40% return on investment. But they have to try, and cook some books to keep the money from investors flowing in as long as possible. \n\nThe 'golden age' of low cost food delivery is over (just like the 'golden age' of cheap Uber rides has been over for a few years now).",

I've got two friends living there currently.\n\nRooms are decently sized and the units are fully furnished. Full appliances. Not a \"party\" apartment by any means so Friday nights are fairly chill. Close enough to campus to walk. The staff (while I was there) was friendly, and I saw a few property manager changes. Amenities are lackluster. Pool is sad and the \"gym\" is just a elliptical and treadmill, but if you're a student, you're paying for the colvin anyways so just go there. \nSecurity is meh. There's gates around the premises that require a passcode but sometimes these just get propped open. This wasn't a problem before Covid, but while I was there my senior year, the office (which also acted as the package office) never had anyone there to receive the packages so they got left outside the office. There are parcel boxes in the mail locker section, but they can take only one small box for one person. So yeah. Believe this is still the case now. I did have a bike stolen, although I do think that may have been my fault. Might have left it unlocked all summer. There are bike racks on each floor outside the units if you're up for carrying it up the stairs or biking up the garage like a lunatic (me). \nAnother gripe would be response time to maintenance calls. Only a handful of techs working so sometimes it takes them a bit to get to you. Parking garage is another thing to be careful of. I drive a sedan so it was fine for me, but two cars cannot drive through easily at the same time, especially going up the ramps.\nThey are pet friendly...which means people who have animals and live on the upper floors, so be prepared for poop in the stairwell, which you will always take because there is no elevator. The property could definitely be cleaner, but I blame the people living there for not caring, not so much the staff.\n\nOverall, probably rate it like a 6/10. Gets the job done. Lived there because I was on a budget and could walk to campus. Rent never increased. Staff is nice. Negatives are everything I mentioned above. If you have any more questions, dms should be open.",

Then, they  put the house on the market, expected us to be home to 'show it' (and when we refused to work as a realtor for them for free, they'd just send the buying agents with their prospective buyers to show up without the legally required notice). The house sold, and the new owner, who also owned just a few houses in town and an insurance company, also told us that nothing would get fixed, and we had no options to renew the lease because their kid was going to move in and at the same time they wouldn't let us out of the lease early under any circumstance because our rental contract was 'bought' with the house. \n\nAll around, both those people were complete and total assholes.",

There was a few the first week, last week seemed to be a bit of a break, but now the full force of the variant seems to be coming down upon this campus. This is looking bad -- we want to have a 'normal semester', we want to teach face to face, but with Delta and so many of our students not yet vaccinated we are marching off a cliff here. Even after this variant waves over us, other waves will come, and our entire student body and experience suffers because of the (too large of a) minority of students who prefer the political statement of not getting a vaccine more than they want to protect themselves and others from this disease.\n\nI think our only option as a society to move forward and past this epidemic is to treat it as the highly contagious and highly virulent disease it is. That means vaccination requirements. If OSU doesn't require it, we will have a Spring semester of chaos while we get to watch other campuses in the country (with vaccine requirements) get on with more 'normal' student experiences.

But, we have half the population in Oklahoma still not vaccinated!\n\nDelta spreads very easily (upper end of what is possible for viruses!) -- And, people who are sick with it shed a lot of active virus and that virus is more likely to take hold and cause another infection. It also spreads faster than the original, with less incubation times meaning by the time someone knows they were exposed, they are likely well underway in terms of spreading it themselves (unless their immune system has successfully suppressed it).\n\nSo, for unvaccinated people, it's a certainty that you are going to be exposed (unless you live in isolation) in these buildings. And for vaccinated people, we are being exposed all the time too now (mostly from the unvaccinated people who are shedding high amounts of virus). That leads to some breakout infections, during which, secondary exposures are still possible, especially to unvaccinated people, like our kids.\n\nWith the new variants that are more vaccine resistant, thus far, they don't spread quite as easily as Delta, so it is not yet certain that they will take hold right now when delta is winning the race towards infecting susceptible people. The hope is that when a vaccine resistant variant does start to pose a widescale risk, that we can get boosters during the lead time that are effective against it.  And that is what the long term may be like \\~ Yearly boosters and occasional and localized 'emergencies' needed where new variants start to spread before said boosters get out there. The more society is vaccinated though, the fewer viruses that are 'out there' potentially gaining random mutations that increase its survivability and the more time we have between 'outbreaks' and needed boosters. The less virus there is, the less virus there is to 'try out' new mutations against us.",

        "body": "Undergraduate TAs are -hourly- employees. Graduate TAs are on a monthly stipend. An undergraduate TA clocks in/clocks out and gets paid for every hour of work. A Graduate TA doesn't 'count hours' and is getting a stipend to support their living expenses during graduate school, during which they are expected to complete significant time doing research for their thesis or dissertation.\n\n Most graduate TAs in my department work 10-25 hours a week on TA duties (Depending on the week), 25-35 hours a week on their dissertation research and another 10-20 hours a week on their own coursework. In most cases, their dissertation research is supported by an external grant that picks up their salary during winter break, summer, and other semesters of their graduate work, but even during their TA paid semesters has reporting requirements and benchmark expectations that need to be met. It's all a full-time plus job where the student gains research and teaching experience while studying at the frontiers of their field. It's intense, and a TA by all means becomes extra work compared to the semesters they are supported on Research Assistantships (RAs). I do my best to 'spread out' the TA work so that none of my students carry significantly more burden as a TA as any other, and keep all of my graduate students paid full time 12 months a year, primarily from research grants. The TA money helps me carry out teaching missions, trains the graduate students, and keeps students funded 12 months a year instead of just the 6-8 months a year that most grants are able to cover.\n\nMost -undergraduate TAs- in my department work 10-20 hours a week and are paid something like $12-15 an hour -- which is more than most can make off campus. There is never-a problem finding undergraduates that want to TA. They are paid for their work, and that is that. Like most jobs for undergraduates on campus, students typically take them to help take the edge off of living expenses and tuition bills, and have a little walking around money during the semester. Many have scholarship support as well, thanks to generous alumni donors. During summers, they go off and do internships (usually, for pretty good pay). It's completely different.\n\nAnother thing: I found the use of undergraduate for TAs to be quite uncommon at most R1 universities. R1 institutions are typically very focused on graduate student education, training, and research, and see TAs as mechanisms to increase graduate enrollment and support the training of graduate students. No institution I have been at before gives so many on campus hourly jobs as OSU gives. Which is great for the undergrads to have those options, but I do think it short-changes our research mission to some degree, where OSU has a lot of room to grow.",

While a lot of undergrads rely on financial aid and scholarships to get through school, most grad students have to TA in exchange for a tuition waiver and a small paycheck (a chunk of which has to go back to the school for fees, as most only have tuition waved) to cover tuition and afford to live. For most graduate students, that tuition waiver and small paycheck is really the ONLY way to pay for graduate school unless you're lucky enough to pay everything out of pocket. Very few people have time for an outside job as well as doing a thesis in only 2 years, and most any job you would have time for would not cover the thousands you owe the school every semester.",

Sometimes you are on campus way more than that, making your \"hourly rate\" absurdly low. \n\nIt's why you should never look at a stipend as hourly pay for one part of your duties as a Grad student.\n\nIf you don't have TA duties, you'll generally have a smaller stipend, unless your program is even more research heavy (in which the stipend is unchanged due to the number of required hours on campus).",

        "body": "I agree with the letter that we need to act more aggressively to get back to masking on campus. We did it all of last year -- easy to enforce (relatively), and quite effective at reducing transmission. We also should require vaccines for Spring enrollment in the same way we require other vaccinations.\n\nBut, the testing? I think that creates too much of a burden. The benefits of testing last year was identifying positive cases during the 'incubation period' of people who have been contact traced as exposed. And it helped quite a bit, but the scene is different now. For one, the incubation period of \"delta\" is like 4 days instead of 6-10 days. By the time someone schedules their test, goes and gets it, and get their test result back, they are past the incubation period anyways. But, My big concern with mass testing is this: vacinnated folks (and recovered folks) can test positive when they have a low-level of virus being effectively fought off from an exposure, but evidence shows (quite strongly) that people who don't show any symptoms but test positive for the virus just don't transmit to others effectively. There is too little 'live' viral load to infect others with.  ((Even unvacinnated people who never show symptoms have fairly low levels of viral shedding and fairly low transmission capabilities. Tests either show you have the RNA of the virus or you have the antigens of the virus. It doesn't show you are shedding live -infectable- virus))). So, I think mass testing could cause way too many people being forced into unnecessary quarantine, in addition to being generally 'after the fact', and a large operational headache and expense.\n\nAs for social distancing -- I think with half or better people being vaccinated, we can worry a lot less about this now. We have in effect better 'social distancing' between possible disease transmitters and susceptible (unvaccinated) people now than we did last year.\n\nAs for having professors 'choose' the way they teach class -- No, I don't think so, not the way this is written anyways. I -do- think professors should have full autonomy to do online office hours only, and some courses can certainly move online just fine.  But there are a lot of courses that really need to be in person for students to engage effectively with the material (most of the undergraduate STEM courses). There is a certain elitism to claim that professors shouldn't be 'forced' to teach in person when most of them fully expect Sprouts, their child's daycare, Lowes (etc) have in person employees. Some of what professors teach -is- just as essential to be done in person as those other jobs are.\n\nIn the end, the way I see it is that the vaccines are massively effective. Everyone knows of breakthrough cases, but those people still recover easily and they are statistically very few. We will not get to zero Covid, ever. We have to accept that we have to find a way to live with this disease on this planet. And that means requiring vaccines and masking when case rates are high, but that is it. Seem like we have half the population in this country wanting to endlessly live in March 2020 panic mode until we reach some unobtainable goal, and the other half that wants to foolishly ignore the mass casualties that the disease causes. If we would just have vaccine mandates and when cases are high (like now) mask mandates, we can see a return to some level of normalcy while offering a high level of protection from death and long-term diseases from COVID. Our BIGGEST problem is unvacc'ed people not wearing masks being around people. Focus on -that- without dragging the entirety of society into a bunch of rules.",

Also have rented a house (3 bed/1bath) with friends that they paid I think $460 each, mine was a little more with pets. All of our utilities were included there.

Technically students have no protection if they test positive (it is up to the instructor how they choose to handle it) which just encourages even more spreading. Would a mask mandate help? Sure it would.

And for the most part, the first week of school has been normal. \n\nBut now it does give me a lot of anxiety. Half of my classes are large lecture classes where there are more than 100 people packed into a lecture hall with only 10% max wearing masks. I guess I just assumed we would still be trying to social distance a bit. \n\nPlus the university is \"strongly encouraging\" masks. I agree with your point that most college students won't do it unless mandatory. And unfortunately, the population of those who are not vaccinated likely coincides with those not wearing masks. \n\nI know that there are a ton of students who have not only had contact with covid, but have covid themselves. And since delta is so contagious, I really would not be surprised if we have to close down school later this year if this doesn't get under control. Right now though, its making me nervous to even go home. Even though I've gotten the vaccine, I obviously know its not 100% effective, especially against delta. \n\nBoth of my parents are older and my sister-in-law is immunocompromised and cannot get the vaccine. Yet, there are weekends that I have to go home for doctors appointments, etc. I'm not exactly sure what to do and I'm honestly incredibly disappointed in America, Oklahoma, and OSU for their responses to the ongoing pandemic. It just seems like once the vaccine requirements were met, everyone decided covid wasn't a thing anymore.",

(As stated above, OSU is prevented from requiring it.)\n\nIf any students don't feel comfortable going into a crowded classroom, I recommend that they talk to their instructor. Start that conversation!\n\nAnd please stay informed on the efficacy of vaccine usage, mask usage and other safety precautions. This is a research-based institution, and we have plenty of information that can help.",

        "body": "Most college students are trying to figure this out. And it's easy to blame the surroundings for being bored.\n\nBut seriously -- Walk around the streets of Chicago, NYC, or San Fran at night and what are the locals doing? \n\nMostly watching TV, sitting at home. Seriously, next time you go, look at the windows in apartment after apartment and you will see the flickering of lights from the TVs in nearly every unit. It is easy to be bored anywhere!\n\nI've lived in a lot of places -- big cities, beach-side, mountain west, east coast and west coast. Stillwater is the smallest place I have lived (by far). Some observations:\n\n1. Even when I've lived across from the beach, it's amazing how hard it is to find time to go to the beach. I still have laundry, dishes, cooking, work, dr. appointments, bills to pay, people to call, etc, and at best, I'd only capture an hour here and there through the week to actually enjoy the beach. When I lived about 20 minutes from some great areas to hike and mountain bike living in the mountain west, I got maybe 1 weekend every two months to actually go out and do something in those mountains. \n\nJust because you live next to an attraction, even one that people spend good money to enjoy from around the world, doesn't mean it suddenly provides lots of things to do.  It's just something to do every once in a while when you find the time and energy to go about and do it.\n\nStillwater still has these sorts of things to do -- Tulsa has some great bike trails. Within 3 hours, there are nice places to hike, and some cool spots around Oklahoma (Turner Falls, Roman Nose state park, any of our lakes, Wichita Mountains, etc). I wish we had more places closer, but there is a lot for a Saturday day trip. The issue is activation energy. You just have to plan and actually go. You can't wait for others to plan and pull you along.\n\n 2. A lot of activities that people do are not location specific. A lot of dorms have kitchens -- try some cooking if you can! Don't forget the pleasure of a good book -- OSU has a lot of great reading spots. The AMC in town is a lot nicer than what used to be there -- catch a movie. Working out and/or swimming is a habit a lot of people enjoy. We have a decent assortment of shops for easy/light shopping. Gaming with friends is a lot of fun. The old adage that only boring people get bored is true in this regard.\n\n3. Occasional travel does wonders. If your budget allows, look for a cheap trip somewhere. You can road trip with a bunch of friends to the Grand Canyon, or Yellowstone, or the South Coast, etc  from here over Spring Break. Evaluate some flight options out of SWO -- sometimes, you can get a bargain fare to New Orleans over a weekend (plus a day or two of skipping class).\n\n4. The one big shortcoming we have I think is our food scene. We are well-underserved in terms of restaurants, especially anything walkable from campus. The one thing that I miss about the other places I lived was just being able to walk down a street and pick a place to eat (and/or have a beer) - location chosen on a whim. The Strip has a few places to eat and a bunch of dank bars. It's a sad assortment of offerings.  There is only a few options around the bend, and then everything else is at least a short drive which means you have to choose a destination before hand, and deal with the parking and the logistics when you are meeting up with people (more complicated than just meeting up and then walking down a street to pick something out; and you can't 'accidently' get tipsy when you have to drive home). And we just don't have much and what we have just isn't all that awesome. I can count on one hand the number of places I actually -enjoy- going out to for food that are currently open. Oddly, we have tons of low-end fast food options at the same time.  I think this is a big problem with just our part of the country, Tulsa and OKC are just large enough that there is some good food areas if you seek it out and you know where to look.\n\n It's just beyond weird to me still after living here for a decade now, that we don't have any true dim sum options in the entire state (outside of a couple truly aweful places in OKC that do it on weekends), only *now* are we getting a Raman restaurant (I am eagerly awaiting their opening, 10 years behind the rest of the country), we only have rumors of a future brew-pub restaurant, our Thai restaurant is most famous for sugar glaze covered fried chicken (yes, it tastes kind of good sometimes, but that isn't really thai food), we don't have any authentic latin american restaurants, a creole restaurant failed practically the year it opened, the only place it seems to get Indian food is out of a food truck or a convenience store counter, is there any middle eastern food?, How about Neapolitan style pizza, and an Irish pub? Can you really say we have a Chinese (Cantonese) restaurant that is actually really good? -- the ones we have are not great -- Boba is the only one that seems to care about what they serve, but that is still not a true deep-menu Chinese restaurant, and how about Chinese hot pot  (I credit *Tokyo* pot for serving good food, but it's not the Chinese hot pot places I have had access to everywhere else I've lived and every other college town I've visited)?  And, how about eating outside? We barely have that option anywhere.\n\nThese food options are -standard- in every other college town, and usually within walking distance from campus. Even the university just south of here has -most- of these things within walking distance of campus and they are practically equal in student size and where students come from. So, I think there is a real issue about Stillwater in terms of fun. We have a real limitation on the places to experience great food together. ((And please, please support the few that we have))",

The retail and food scene here is severely lacking, again small Oklahoma town things. It could also use a HeyDay, Dave and Busters or TopGolf, something to eat & play all in one. The bowling alley I've never been, it looks sketchy from the outside, theater is decent. Also all the concerts are country, theres no variety here. All in all I \"like\" Stillwater, its small and things are cheap but I wouldn't live here if I wasn't in school.",

(Mechanical) Design buildings, bridges, highways, and/or water infrastructure? (Civil) Have some interest in the business/operations side of manufacturing (IEM?), Design electrical systems (EE)? Design chemical processes/pathways for the manufacturing of chemicals, pharmaceuticals, etc? (ChemE).\n\nI also caution about overly glorifying the job paths -- few MAEs actually work on airplanes, cars, robots, or anything nearly as exciting as that.  Few CIVEs or ArchEs will design skyscrapers. \n\nAt OSU, MAE is the biggest program, which is true of most universities, though, most universities are *NOT nearly* as MAE heavy as OSU.  \n\nAll programs in CEAT are decently highly regarded in the state and region. Faculty quality is mixed in all programs. Nearly all kids in all the programs have a job lined up by the time they graduate.\n\nIn my personal opinion, Chemical and Civil are the most exciting engineering majors -- ChemEs make the most with a BS degree (which is worth something; but by mid career, this isn't as true anymore). The curriculum of ChemE is also real fundamental and broad, which is good.  On the other hand, Civil offers the most variety and best for students with broad interests -- everything from how soils supports structures, to how to design highways to carry increasing traffic, to bridge and building design, to water treatment and public health. MAE enjoys too high of a stature I think -- most graduates work in low-key manufacturing/light engineering stuff somewhere, doing something rather mundane like designing hydraulic parts. I -very- often find myself board to death when a MAE alumn talks about their job.",

To some, that may be a dealbreaker and for others not so much. While I\u2019ve been in the program, it seems like there\u2019s been an effort to improve the program (getting newer professors, introducing new electives, etc.), but I think there\u2019s still a ways to go before it can be considered \u201cgreat\u201d\n\nAs far as the CS project you\u2019re curious about, we don\u2019t have any sort of mandatory capstone project. You\u2019ll have individual work and a rare group project or two in some of the core classes (Java 2, data structures, operating systems, and a few more in forgetting) and then hands-on individual and group projects in whatever electives you decide. There is a capstone that you can do as senior, but I don\u2019t have much info about it unfortunately\n\nRegarding professors, it\u2019s been a mixed bag from my experience. As another comment mentioned, there\u2019s a lot of new professors, but the good news is that all of the bad/disliked ones are no longer teaching undergrad courses. To put it into perspective, there were 4-5 professors I had that I considered terrible and only 1 of them is still teaching at OSU. I\u2019ve had professors that I\u2019ve considered excellent and others that I consider average, so I\u2019d say expect a little bit of everything. But keep in mind I may have also been lucky with my professors\n\nOverall, I think the program is as good as you make it. When I talk to friends studying CS at other schools (Baylor, UT, UT Dallas, OU, Vandy, TAMU, Stanford), I don\u2019t feel like OSU\u2019s program has put me at any airt of disadvantage, but I put in a fair amount of time outside of school to sharpen some skills. OSU doesn\u2019t have the same support and network as other schools, so keep that in mind also. Reach out if you have any other questions!",

Hospitals in OKC and Tulsa are approaching (or in some cases at or above) capacity as well. Even if college students were immune to COVID (they are not) or our student body was fully vaccinated (they are not), they're not immune to other causes of hospitalization. Bringing in over ten thousand more people to Stillwater *will* result in a rise in hospitalizations due to non-COVID causes. If someone gets in a wreck or has appendicitis or something in Stillwater, it is not unlikely it would take a long while to find a bed for them. It would probably be in another hospital, possibly even in another state. It's not unreasonable to expect that their condition could get considerably worse while Stillwater's ER docs try to find a bed for them or during their trip to the nearest hospital bed available for transfers, which could be in Arkansas or Texas at this point.\n\nI really don't think it's unreasonable to criticize this.",

I wasn't considering seriously other schools but wanted to visit to be sure (family was poor, I thought my options were limited to in state, and OU's program in my major was and still is inferior). \n\nI liked the campus -- my only negative thoughts were 1. the stadium was ugly (this was pre-Boone pickens, the stadium now I think is one of the best there is) 2. Too much mass parking lots (which is still true).\n\nCampus has gotten even prettier since overall -- the Business school provides a nice anchor on the east side (compared to what was there), the new engineering Endeavor building and Architecture school expansion helps fill in that side too. The Health and Human sciences expansion dresses up Monroe.  But, there are areas of campus that were better -- the area behind the library (international mall) used to have a few diagonal paths with trees and benches, and now it is just grass with oddly placed drainage grates (can't find a good picture of it, unfortunately). And the 'big path' going east/west from HHS and Business was parallel sidewalks with nice trees and benches in between. I get why it needed expanded (those sidewalks were crowded), but the result is still more pavement and heat where there used to be very good shade and sitting areas.  The one big wish I have for campus is thicken the tree cover in some places and put in outdoor study areas. Our campus is gorgeous for walking, but you can be hard-pressed to find a spot to eat a grab and go lunch and read a book.",

Low plain brick buildings in prominent central campus places --  OSU has some plainish brickish buildings too but only in some of its farther reaches of campus. And 2. Really bad examples of 1960s and 70s blank walls to the sidewalk, brutalist tower in the background, stuff. And inside these buildings, OU is much more run-down. I've worked in their labs for a short period of time and was shocked at how run-down these spaces were.  I do  give Norman the slight edge though when it comes to adjacent-to-campus eating/drinking establishments (Campus corner in Norman > the strip + racist Joes), but both Norman and Stillwater have a lot of improvement in that department.",

Also, wear a mask. OSU can't make everyone wear a mask, but you still reduce your personal risk, and the risk around you, by doing so. OSU can't mandate masks, but you can do your part in being mask-positive. Even with Delta, the likelihood of you getting sick and spreading COVID if you are vaccinated and masked indoors and avoid unnecessary crowds is fairly low. Breakthrough infections occur pretty much in cases where people aren't masking (i.e. - they got it at a crowded bar ) and are still statistically much much lower than the unvaccinated.  And cases are still mild. I am hoping we are all able to get third shots which look very promising at boosting defenses even higher though.\n\nThere will for sure be a wave of Delta cases on campus, probably peaking in early September, but then I'd expect it to fall off again. This wave will impact the unmasked, unvaccinated students the hardest (DASNR??). From the people I know, OSU is ready to let these kids get sick and their personal repercussions lay where they may. There is -zero- appetite to close school (and there has been zero appetite since this point last year to go through another shutdown).\n\nSo, I worry about the Fall, about the number of kids that may get sick, the number of vaccinated kids that may have a short case of it, the flu season which may be rather harsh in its own right, and the professors that have to find a way to manage all of this. But I am not worried about OSU going through a shutdown again.",

You can do solo training, buddy training, group training, once or multiple times a week, etc (the more people, the cheaper it is I think). Plus you have a knowledgeable person guide you through personalized workouts for whatever your fitness goals are, and get to use low traffic areas of the gym just for personal training. They take an assessment your first session and then you get to see the progress you've made by the end of the semester. I really enjoyed and recommend it.",

For the sake of brevity I do agree with your statements, but luckily they already possess several transfer credits and after this first year room and board would not be a factor in the cost.  The latter amounted to nearly 6k, which I know isn't bad in the grand scheme of college costs but seems absurd after evaluating rental units nearby.\n\nThey will also be looking at CC credits that would transfer to reduce overall program cost. With that in mind, did/do you know of a local CC that is set to transfer credits to OSU? I think there was a master list of accepted transfer credits, but I cannot seem to find the document. \n\nMany thanks again for the effort you put into your comment, we appreciate it!",

No different than a country club making up rules for membership to purposefully include the founding membership but and exclude others. \n\nI do find the news story (very widely circulated, like, to a weird level) to be rather odd. The story is basically this ESPN insider who tweeted that people told him something.   And, let's say he talked to some ADs and school presidents or the head of the Big10, and this is obviously just a politically motivated story plant -- ie \"shh, the big 10 says we are only looking at AAU schools LIKE TEXAS but oh yeah -- EXCEPT NOTRE DAME (of course).\"\" So, it's either just hearsay from unreliable sources, or, it is someone in the Big10 trying to give a not-so-subtle plea to get the attention of Texas and Notre Dame (before it is too late).",

        "body": " Once conferences are this big, you either look at the 3 schools that would be in a 'pod', or the division of 7 other schools you are likely amongst. The other -side- of the conference you meet half as often (at the most).\n\nI don't think the Pac12 is necessarily that bad geographically. Assuming they take us + a few other schools (K State, Texas Tech, and Houston or someone else), then whether they set us up in a pod system or in a east/west division split, most games are in our time zone or Mountain west. There would only be 2 away football games a season to the actual west coast.\n\nIf the big 10 takes us and Kansas (for example), then you have Kansas (4 hours drive), Nebraska (5.5 hours drive), and Iowa (and Illinois) (9 hours drive) that are closer or at least not really that much farther than our long-time conference mate Iowa State. ((And for reference, Austin and our old conference mate TexasA/M is about 7 hours away)).  And the majority of Big10 schools are closer to us than West Virginia.\n\nThe ACC is the only one that I think geography is a big challenge. They are a big enough conference all of which is beyond 12 hours driving distance from us.\n\nIt is true, that in the no-Big12 world, we are going to be on the edge of a conference, vs being in the center, which is very unique position for us.  \n\n\nI think the biggest issue with either conference is our academics. Other schools will vote on whether OkState is on the same conference banner as their own school. The Big10 is big on AAU membership. But, I guess it is possible they let go of that a little considering that Nebraska dropped off of it for a while and nobody though the Big10 was any less prestigious because of it. The AAU, by the way, is an odd organization. It is invitation only, they keep the doors quite tightly shut for new members, as most members have been members for decades.  They are by all means an old boys network. Officially, they like to see the number of faculty on National Academies (which is itself, an old boys network). They like to see big research dollars, but the only difference research dollar wise between OSU and most AAU members is that we lack a big medical/research program on campus. Kansas has been a member forever, but it is hard to argue that they really are that much different than OSU on any academic metric. OSU has about 20 million dollars more in research than KU if you took the KU Medical Center out of the calculation.  I think the Pac12 is a little looser than the Big10 on the academics front, as if they want to expand, they don't have any Stanfords or UC Berkeleys in Montana or the Dakotas to pick up or anything (whereas, the Big10 can expand still potentially by picking up some AAU member schools in the NE).\n\nThe other thing is media size/market value. This is tough, as it is hard for OSU to contribute more to that pot than we would get in return just in terms of our own TV revenues. But, you have to look at value of the whole. Conferences are all about the sum being much bigger than the parts (every game takes 2 teams to play). So, it isn't just what does OSU markets bring in terms of TV revenue, but does the TV revenue of Iowa, Ohio State, Minnesota, games (etc) go up because they are playing OKState in football, basketball, wrestling, etc. Also, does playing us help shake down donors. I think we might be attractive enough for the Big10 or Pac12, but  that is something these schools will have to evaluate when/if they vote OkState in and it is a bit of a gamble.",

If we, the Kansas schools, and Texas Tech can join in, then the PAC12 goes to 16, and it maintains its focus on big state schools (TCU/Baylor/etc are weird private schools with big football stadiums; they don't fit holistically). Could be split east/west -- OKState, KState, Kansas, Colorado, Texas Tech, Arizona, Arizona State, and Utah makes for a decent regional division.  \n\nThe ACC is already a big league (14 teams!) with all of these teams so far away, that it doesn't interest me whatsoever -- maybe they pick up West Virginia, and Iowa state (though, I could see the Big 10 making a play for Iowa State).

I haven't been able to make a thoughtful comment until I understand the story was real. \n\nI'm not going to go too far out on a limb here, because we don't fully understand what the other major conference thinks of us. If this leads to a forced split, conference-wise from OU. I think this could be one of the best things to ever happen to our athletic program. As long as we land into a major conference at least. \n\nThe idea of breaking out in a league where we Don't has to play Oklahoma in the conference championship game is BEYOND satisfying. The most ideal world is we play in our league and play them once a year, similar to the Clemson/Soth Carolina rivalry. I think having our own \u2018identity\u2019(similar to a&m)and joining another conference could be a massive boost for our program. \n\nNow I'm going to list my favorite outcomes. Ideally, wherever we land, we play Oklahoma in November using SEC special schedule on I believe a week 13?\n\nNow I'll list my favorite landing spots. But the most ideal outcome is we land at any other of the three, but we keep playing it in November. \n\n1)Ben Ten. \nI'm just imagining what would happen to Stillwater on Saturdays when Michigan comes into town. The number of people that will flood the city when highly ranked Wisconsin comes crushing in. The same thing goes for basketball. Honestly. I think the entire city would grow tenfold. I think the city and university would grow tremendously.  Not to mention the fact our school has been trying for YEARS to get a medical school,  Michigan can help us out with this endeavor. \n\n2)ACC- \nControversial take, but I would jump into the ACC over the Pac-12. There are a few pros and cons for both. However, at the end of the day. I think it's a much better culture fit and academic fit for our university and fans. That and if the ACC add us a Notre Dame it looks a lot more appealing. Still, we would be competitive in a lot of sports. \nIt is hard to imagine Oklahoma state being in the Pac-12. I just can see Stillwater athletics being given orders by a group of people living in Walnut Creek, CA. It's hard to imagine the UC system giving an inch of their wacky in conference power. \n\n3) pac 12 \nWhat a crazy world this would be. Pulling into Stillwater the first thing that jumps to your mind is the Pacific ocean? I digress, this would be a massive boost academically. Not to mention our school would instantly be a threat to Oregon, USC, and Washington for conference dominance.  \n\nIt would be amazing for cowboy fans to travel out to Pasadena in November get drunk on a golf course and play UCLA. The main boost other than the appeal of nice weather in October and November. In academics, UCLA has a great medical center, as conference partners they could help us get a medical school. That the massive recruiting boost and having more appeal to west coast talent.",

Athletically, the PAC12 prides themselves in having the most national championships in all sports.

BYU tends to have a lot of caveats in their schedules (holy days, travel restrictions, etc...), so they likely do better as an independent as it is.  That's a viable option, IF Houston wants to do it.... and creates a strong South region and a north region that would likely go to some combination of WVU, Boise State or Iowa state for the next 10 years or so.",

TCU was only added because after the first Big12 schism, we disparately needing teams to join the conference and there was a lot of internal Texas politics pushing for TCU (vs other options). These two schools are -not- inherently attractive universities for 'power' conferences to scoop up, as they were only allowed into the weakest conference and only because of crazy Texas politics. It is more of a fluke that they are where they are.\n\nIn this case, Texas politics won't have any control, other than if they prevent Texas Tech from joining the Pac12 without bringing along Baylor and/or TCU. And if that occurred, I think the Pac12 would laugh, and seriously consider the University of New Mexico, or the University of Nevada, Reno (both R1 schools with growing research programs) to get to 16 before adding Texas Tech. A decade ago, the Pac12 was pretty close to bringing along OSU, OU, Texas, and Texas Tech (which was a condition for brining in Texas). Baylor and TCU were never in the discussion!\n\nAs for the Big10, I am not sure they are interested in expansion for Kansas teams. Their main expansion motive in the last round had to do with one thing and one thing only -- Getting into the major media markets.\n\nAnd yes, I think OSU would have a shot at the Pac12 (though tough) on the attractiveness of our whole-athletic program.",

The Pac is falling imploding/going broke it seems from talking to fans of those teams and I think the last thing we need is another unstable conference. I could also see them picking up Kansas which would be nice for us and basketball.\n\nEdit* I do agree that the Big XII is done for though. No reason to stay here and try to salvage anything.",

What has doomed the B12 from the 90s is that we let Texas and OU run the conference to benefit Texas and OU the most. They had ultimate veto power with anything the conference wanted to do, because they were always clear that they would go elsewhere or independent if they didn't get what they want. They were, by all means, bullies and wanted to make clear that they felt they were doing the Big12 a favor by being members.

If any current marching band members or more recent graduates have any corrections, please make them - I don't want to be giving incorrect info. Also, due to covid, things may be different, so I can't speak to that.\n\nFor the audition, I assume you've already made the band and are talking about the audition during band week? That's *mostly* just to get people to practice over the summer so you aren't rusty when you get there, but it does determine which part you play in your section (1st, 2nd or 3rd depending on which instrument). It's nothing to sweat about, just learn it as best as you can. You won't get kicked out if you mess up. \n\nNow, there *are* a small number of 'alternates' who don't actually march, but those are typically made up of the people who put 0 effort in to learn the music or shows, so as long as you try you should be fine. A lot of music majors have to do marching band because they tend to not have enough people willingly sign up for it.\n\nFor band in general, [Someone asked a similar question a year or two ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/OKState/comments/f92vby/made_the_marching_band/), so I'm going to mostly copy/paste my answer below.\n\n**Band In General**\n\n* If you're coming from a high school where you did a single competitive marching show you learned throughout the whole semester, that's not how it works at OSU (or most/all colleges for that matter). \n* The band learns 4 or 5 shows per year rather than constantly work on one, since it's not for competition - just for football games and the fans. Sometimes you'll have a few weeks to learn it, other times you'll only have one or two. Usually you'll perform each show once, but occasionally you'll play one twice if there are back-to-back home games or a short week.\n* The shows aren't typically too complex marching wise (fewer than 20 different sets per show), but the music can sometimes be challenging. Overall, no one is expecting perfection out of anyone for marching band, but they do expect you to care enough to learn the music and drill, play when you're supposed to at games, etc.\n* The band has a [youtube page](https://www.youtube.com/user/OSUBands/videos) with previous years shows, that they also update during the year, if you're interested in seeing what they've done previously to get an idea of what it's like.\n\n**Band Week**\n\n* The week before school you'll have \"band week\" (band camp) where you'll learn the first show, learn the stands tunes and [fight songs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCotn0EIsnQ), and get to know your section and the rest of the band. Each day was 12 hours when I was there (9-9 with a lunch and dinner break, plus a few other breaks throughout). Part of it will be just with your section, others will be with the full band.\n* You learn the basics of marching as well here if you happen to be form a school where you either marched military-style, or from a high school where you didn't have a marching band.\n* It's a good amount of work, and definitely the most intense part of marching band overall. You'll have a couple of auditions (marching and playing) to determine what part you'll play in your section. At the end of the week you put on a performance for friends/family/alumni and then have a lunch to end the week.\n\n**Weekly Rehearsals**\n\n* Rehearsals were Monday, Wednesday, and Friday from 4-6 when I was there. A lot of times your section leader will have you show up 30 minutes early for sectionals to work on specific things before actual rehearsal. Usually part of it will focus on music in larger groups, then the full band gets together to work on drill and out it all together. Shows usually consist of 10-15 sets, and 2 or 3 songs, since you don't have a lot of time to learn them.\n\n**Game Day (Home Football Games)**\n\n* The real reason the marching band exists! Game day starts early for the band so that we can use the stadium for rehearsal in the morning. For 11 AM games, that means suuuuper early (I'm talking 5-5:30 AM early). You'll do a couple runs of the show to work on any last minute issues, and then typically will have a few hours off to rest.\n* A few hours before the game, a part of the band will go around to play for tailgates, another part will play for the alumni center, and another group will be off for the week (you'll rotate each game which group you're a part of). The 2 'active' groups will be part of 'The Walk', where the teams walk to the stadium. Then you have a quickly indoor rehearsal, and then do a short performance for fans before marching to the stadium.\n* Once you get to the stadium, you'll go out onto the field and do [pregame](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX6iW9xWjfQ). There you'll 'run on' to the field (which is a unique gallop-like run that's hard to explain, but looks cool when the whole band does it). You play a few songs and make a few sets to pump the crowd up, then make a tunnel for the team to run through, then up into the stands for the game. You play in between plays, making a LOT of noise before big defensive plays, and play any time we score or kick off. At halftime you march the halftime show, and then go back into the stands for the rest of the game. During 3rd quarter, they send a couple people from each instrument up to play for people in the suites and get ice cream.\n* After each game, we play the alma mater for the football team and fans, then (one of my favorite parts) the band will sing the alma mater in 4-part harmony. Then you pack up and go home! We USED to play the halftime show in arcs on the field for fans, family, and anyone else who stuck around, but they don't let you do that anymore...#NotBitter #BringBack5thQuarterConcert\n\n**Away Games**\n\n* You'll go on one full band trip to away games each year (occasionally 2 if you play a nearby non-conference opponent as an away game, like Tulsa). The rest of the away games will be 'pep bands' of about 50 people from all instruments. \n* Usually the older members will get 'first dibs' to go on these if they want to, but new members can go sometimes too if you want to and are lucky. You get some spending money (typically not a lot, <$100) for food and whatever else when you go. For games like West Virgina or other far away games (like Boise State this year), the school doesn't send the band sadly (maybe this will change in the future, as other schools do send them). If we go to a bowl game, everyone will go to that as well over the break between semesters.\n\n**Other Notes**\n\n* Hopefully they still do this, but several Friday nights throughout the year a volunteer group would take a 'Spirit Tour' to a high school somewhere in the state (typically small schools, like <50 member bands) and play at one of their games. Intent was to get the kids there excited about college band. Those were a lot of fun, and I recommend doing them if they're still a thing.\n* The fans generally enjoy the marching band here, and a good amount actually stay during halftime to watch and cheer you on. It's pretty great to actually have them cheer for you when you're performing, vs it being mostly empty while everyone is at the concessions.\n\nHonestly, most of the friends I've kept in touch with after college have been from band. The people can really become part of your family if you want them to be, and I'm so glad I kept with it from high school. But marching band is what you make of it. If you want it to be fun, it will be.\n\nHopefully that helps! Good luck and have fun with it! Go Pokes!",

I do know the director of the marching band will be different this year (he was the assistant director when I was there) and I believe he will be intent on making sure the band knows their music better. \n\nFor the fight songs, just do your best! Once you get to the first game, you\u2019ll have already played them about 100 times and have them memorized in no time. The section leaders normally run the auditions for pregame music, which will hopefully make you more comfortable. You will be solid as long as you practice and try your best!! \nAs for the show music, it is typically pretty easy music to memorize in the amount of time they give you. \nAll I can say is go out there and have fun!! I don\u2019t think college would have been near as fun without marching band. As they said above, you will make friends for life!! Also, be sure to check out the band co-ed fraternity and sorority, Kappa Kappa Psi and Tau Bets Sigma :)",

It is no different than scheduling a plumber to come fix your toilet, and then demand that they clean it for you too because of how much you are paying to have your toilet fixed.\n\nProfessors got burnt out last year. Spring 2020 was chaos in action, but it was just a couple quick months, everything was delivered online, and everyone accepted 'good enough'. Fall 2020 was brutal though, because a lot of profs had to teach online and in person. All of the research sides of professors jobs (grant proposals submitted, papers published, etc) took a huge hit. Professors freely admit they became worse instructors too because they were spending so much time dealing with Canvas discussions, email questions, video posting, lecture note posting, technology issues in the classroom, online grading, etc. Every student suffered from having burnt out professors. I don't like how much students pay for tuition nowadays, but that has nothing to do with professors and their workload.\n\nAnyways, I worry about COVID this fall too.

        "body": "Well, I certainly feel for all of you students. I was a student right when it started to get expensive (the 90s), but even then, a summer internship and 30 hour a week off campus job at least could pay the bursar -and- the rent (the rent in Stillwater, actually, wasn't that different back then. Same apartment I had in 1999 rents today for just 15% more). It was tight, but at least doable! But, to be a cash cow, the milk has to be flowing to someone -- the only people getting rich around here are the sports coaches, but they do so mostly on the backs of unpaid student athletes (college sports is a cash cow).     The problem is multifold, but it is known --\n\n1. The biggest thing -- The state has cut cut cut while piling on layer over layer of regulation and accounting.  Probably costs more for OSU to comply with ridiculous state travel and accounting standards than it gets from the state in support.  When I was a student, OSU got nearly 40% of its operating costs paid for directly from the state, now, it is like 10-14%, meanwhile, the entire campus can't process a $100 voucher without going past 5 different approvals to make sure the expense and reimbursement meets hundreds of pages of regulations.\n2. Students keep demanding more out of universities. Research demonstrably shows that enrollment goes up when universities build new dorms, rec centers, undergrad lab buildings, revamp student unions etc. I thought this was all b.s., but then I found the studies and it is actually quite clear, a single new facility on campus (new rec center, health center, lab building, classroom building, etc) increases hard applicants, student enrollment, and reported satisfaction  --  Academics is a weird market, where these big institutions have irrational 17 year old prospective students for their primary consumer. Parents aren't rational either, they want their kid to go where the kid wants to go. OSU shows high schoolers shiny things, and they end up applying and coming more. I don't know how to break that, but every campus today has more glorified facilities than they did 25 years ago. We didn't have lazy rivers, practice facilities for the band, a dedicated music school building and performance hall, engineering labs dedicated for undergrad classes, student organization offices at the union, heck, I can't even remember where we had space (other than the library) to meet with classmates and study, and now, every newly renovated floor and new building has all sorts of student common areas. Even if a lot of the initial cost gets paid for by donors, the ongoing utility and maintenance costs get covered from tuition. And it includes student support too. We didn't have nearly the support staff back then in terms of counselors, tutoring services, teaching assistants, IT support, etc. We didn't have online learning platforms -- we went to class, and twice a year would get our grades off a sheet of paper posted on the wall outside the classroom showing our grades with our student ID numbers (aka. social security numbers). Okay, some changes are good (online platforms are quite useful for posting assignments, notes, and grades; tutoring helps with retention), but there is still a bigger underlying cost structure.\n\nAnyways, there is more -- but this is mostly it. Most people won't vote on these issues, but there is a political issue on that first point there, and here in Oklahoma, the major political shift in the last 20 years have been to cut financial support for public schools and triple the regulatory burden. On the second point, the only thing you can do is try to be rational and guide your kid for a university that balances cost with facilities. OSU, might very likely, still be relative bargain.",

        "body": "I have experience at four other state universities in the last 10 years:\n\nOne school had a lottery system -- Students could enter the lottery for one of only like 800 parking permits for two different student garages totally 500 parking spaces. If you won the lottery (10-15% chance, totally randomized except freshman were excluded), the fee was over $1000 for the academic year for a permit, and you still had to arrive before 9 to have a chance at a spot because it was oversold. And parking was enforced 24-7, year round!  The campus had a lot of lame tiny surface lots and on street parking zones all over the place too, which made for kind of a ugly on campus vibe, but they were all reserved for the big shot faculty and admins.\n\nOne school didn't have student parking, period. Even grad student employees didn't have parking. A few private companies built garages and they were about $100-150 a month to park in depending on location (most were right next to campus though, so the location was good). Mostly, it was just faculty and staff who bought passes to those garages due to the high cost and the ability to outwait the waiting list. There was some on campus parking too for faculty and staff, but it was more expensive and over-sold. Commuting to that campus was very easy though -- great public transit in that city and great cycling lanes going in every direction from campus for miles. Every building had a huge mess of bike parking because that is how most students went to campus! Very few people there actually complained about the parking situation because it was so easy to commute. And, this city is not very big (about the size of Tulsa) and was still car centric in most regards.\n\nAnother campus had a system that priorities parking by student rank. Grad students, seniors and some juniors got parking, and the cost was actually reasonable (300 a year I think), but there was no way for a \\*freshman or sophomore to get a permit, and the nearest student spot was about 1/2 a mile from the edge of the part of campus with classes.  Most students parked closer to a mile away. Decent 20-30 minute walk, but most students just took a shuttle. Parking was enforced until 7 PM.\n\nAnother one had parking for just about anyone that really wanted to pay for it. Parking was garage specific, but anyone could apply for a given permit (some had waiting lists though) and all garages were somewhat oversold (but only like 10-20%, so you still pretty much could always park when you needed to). Each garage/permit had it's own price point. Starting at 250 a month for two garages actually within the center of campus -- only admins and highest paid medical school faculty parked there, and my understanding is that most got it for \"free\" as a part of their negotiated compensation package. So many Mercedes and Jaguars going in and out of that one.  If you were willing to a walk to some surface lots about 1.5 miles away, it got as cheap as $250 a year. Most faculty and staff I knew, walked about 1/2 a mile to their cars and paid somewhere like 600-800$ a year for parking. Staff and students either parked way out and shuttled in, or just took city transit. That campus was beautiful at least -- the center of campus was so green and walkable -- few through roads, and the few center-campus garages were completely underground. But, at the cost that even decently-paid faculty have to walk clear off campus, across 2-3 busy roads, past several bars/restaurants (etc) just to get to their parking garage.\n\nSo, we have it good, we have it real good really. The best thing is that at 5PM and on weekends, you can park in any lot, making it quite easy to leave campus in the afternoon and come back for an evening activity.  I hope we never change that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*The bot doesn't like the word freshman due to gender inclusiveness. But \"Freshman\" is still the technical term for someone without any post-high school credit hours, and is still the most precise way to define this student status. \"first year\" student is rather undefined, as it could mean first year graduate student, first year transfer student, neither of which are the same as 'freshman'. So, my apologies to anyone that is offended by the term \"Freshman\" -- maybe we just change it to \"freshperson\" or something, but \"First year\" is not a good substitute.",

They really piss me off and operate as a monopoly.  They have bought out a lot of the competition in the last 15 years in town, jacked up the negotiated rates with insurances to stupid high prices, and I would say IF YOU NEED TO GO TO THE HOSPITAL AND CAN MAKE IT TO OKC OR TULSA, then do so. Not only are SMC prices way higher than the OKC or Tulsa hospitals, but they too often transfer patients to those places anyways and so you pay huge fees walking into the door and being seen by SMC, only for them to say you need to go somewhere else for what you need.\n\nI made the error of going there for an ER visit once, they charged me about $1500 for their negotiated rate with my insurance just for a 2 hour ER visit, some xrays, and a couple quick doctor visits. I still pay a deductible, so this is real cash! All they did was figure they didn't have the specialist I needed and they sent me to OU medical in OKC, where I had to pay for another ER visit (which was half the cost though) and get admission. Luckily I could still drive there, they wanted me to go by ambulance but I refused because that would have cost me thousands.\n\nA neighbor of mine, took their kid to the ER there. Same story, got charged over a thousand dollars for walking into the door, and then was sent to OU Childrens because SMC doesn't really treat children, even for relatively minor surgeries.\n\nAnd this isn't just the ER. All in-patient and out-patient services are high there. I know of a student, who needed a fairly routine surgery but had time to quote it out at least. SMC quoted a price of like 20,000, at OKC Baptist it was 6,000.  These things matter when you have any health insurance with a high deductible and high out of pocket maximums. SMC though just milks the crud out of the OSU staff and faculty that are on the high-premium health plans and don't see these costs as directly. But that money to cover a good deal of that insurance cost (15K+ per employee), comes out of tuition/fees and other streams. They are like a leach on the college community. That is where all these new sparking facilities are coming from.",

And then of course, there is New York City which is a worlds apart different from that.\n\nStillwater is a usual college town, but with the crime of being too close to Tulsa and Oklahoma City to hold onto too much of our own retail, food, and culture.\n\nCulturally, Stillwater isn't much different than a place like Syracuse or Buffalo or Rochester, except for the undergrads in the Ag college who can be a bit redneck but you can easily enough ignore them if you wish.\n\nCost of living is cheap. So cheap, that it can be harder to meet people because you don't have to get a bunch of roommate to pay the rent. So, it's important to lean into getting to know the other graduate students in your department and college, both in and out of the lab. Suggest to them to hang out at a bar, or go grab lunch, or have a bbq on the weekend, and you should get invites in return and before long, you will be finding lots of good friends. The biggest problem grad students make (anywhere), is waiting too long waiting to be explicitly invited to things, and they get lonely.\n\nThe Integrative Biology faculty and grad students are great btw, I know some quite well in fact. There are a few 'characters', but the department is one of the most underrated departments at OSU compared to what the average joe knows.  I won't say more than that, I need to keep a level of anonymity here. But that brings me to my last point: At OSU, one of the bigger annoyances is that our Ag college gets so much local recognition and credit. Being an Ag school is a weird big part of the identity. But, our Chemistry, Biology, Microbiology, Math, (etc) programs are the ones that really do the academic heavy lifting of publishing papers in top journals and doing top notch rigorous science. It's just weird that all of that exists but you just won't see it promoted within OSU or locally at all.  Anyways, not a big deal, I just don't want that to catch you off guard.",

There are some fun little things to do around town but you might also end up driving to OKC or Tulsa. If you're from NYC you might hate the mediocre walkability of the town and relative lack of public transit, as well as the scarcity of 24-hour establishments.\n\nOutside of the university, there aren't a lot of buildings more than 2 stories tall. \n\nAside from gas stations, the only things open late at night tend to be 2 or 3 fast food restaurants. \n\nPublic transit is the campus bus service, which has some routes that go all over town but they all chiefly serve the campus.\n\nThere's a strip of bars and restaurants near campus and several other fun spots sprinkled all over town that take a car to get to. If you want to get dressed up and go on a bar crawl somewhere with lots of nightlife you'll have to take a trip to Tulsa or OKC.\n\nIf you like nature, you're in luck. Parks, lakes, jogging trails, bike paths, etc, are numerous within 20 minutes of campus. Plenty of places to camp. The university also had some great outdoor clubs when I was there, before the pandemic. Sailing, archery, etc.",

Theoretically, as an undergraduate, you can re-take a class and the previous one will have no effect on your GPA calculation.

Depending on OP's major and what kind of school they attended before, OSU may structure their degree program completely differently from the other institution, to the point of not even having any useful transfer credits at all.  Example: major in fashion design, take first two years at Stephens College (a small private all-female school in Missouri), then try to transfer to OSU.  Not possible.  The Stephens College fashion design curriculum covers the same material as OSU's, but the courses are structured so differently and taken in such a completely different order that you would have to start over.\n\n(Also, why would you assume that other institutions use the same course number for an equivalent class?)",

(For instance - student takes a course labeled MATH 1314 College Algebra elsewhere, which is equivalent to our college algebra, so it will be on their OSU transcript as MATH 1513 and work to replace a failing grade of a previous MATH 1513 attempt on their OSU transcript.)",

        "body": "OK, thank you for explaining further.  I am somewhat mollified by the fact that it's each individual department that makes the determination of equivalence.  I've taken classes at another institution where the equivalent of College Algebra was called Math 101.  So, if I had taken that, and then transferred to OSU where they decided to list the MATH 101 credit as MATH 1513, I shouldn't then have to worry about the department later changing its mind and saying, \"no, that's not really MATH 1513, it's really more equivalent to our MATH 1483.\"  And if they did do that, presumably one could appeal to the department head, if it created a problem.\n\nI think /u/AnonymousRockstar should attempt to get the course equivalence determination in writing from whoever is ultimately responsible for making that decision, before finalizing plans for what courses they're taking to attempt a replacement with a better grade.  It sounds like they may not have a choice of whether the credits transfer or not.\n\nI have one question, since you seem so knowledgeable about OSU's procedures.  What if an undergraduate student re-takes a class, but gets a worse grade than before?  Does the later grade always replace the earlier one, or does the better grade stay on the transcript no matter which was taken first?",

If you take the remedial course, then you \\**should*\\* learn the foundational skills necessary to then get the math placement score you need to take a course at OSU. BUT more importantly - NOC now offers **co-requisite** courses. Students with low ACT scores can take the remedial AND College-level course at the same time to clear remediation as well as earning college credit in the same semester.\n\nThe math learning modules are very helpful and working in those for a few hours to refresh your math skills is honestly the best advice! Clearing remediation is a Board of Regents requirements and has to be done, so it isn't very wise to tell students not to take the remedial course they need.",

Also unfortunate that our highschools aren't teaching math well enough for you all that you need remedial coursework to learn the stuff you should have learned in high school.\n\n\\----\n\nThe 0 at the beginning of the four digit course number by definition means that you don't get credit. All 0XXX courses carry zero credit for any degree plan. They are pre-freshman level courses, and NOC and OSU aren't high schools so they don't dole out high school level credit or use high school classes as credit for college degrees.\n\nAnd, yeah, courses generally don't use a 0XXX for a pre-requisite any more than they will look if you took something in 11th grade as a pre-requisite to a college class. \\[\\[ Generally speaking, pre-requisite lists are a tricky subject -- once they get listed, OSU has to make exceptions for the students who don't need the pre-req (paperwork!) and then the regents can wonder why are we calling something a pre-req that most students are getting an exception too, and students that have to do the pre-req will complain that other students don't have to do it, OSU gets sued, and it just gets to be a mess. The number of pre-requisite listings at OSU and colleges everywhere has been cut a lot over the last decade to avoid administrative hurdles when they aren't necessary, and students and parents have become more and more likely to sue for 'unequal treatment'. All the lawyer needs to do is open records request the departments emails for the last few years to create a million dollar headache for the university to comply with, and then the lawyer just needs to uncover a single email chain that suggests that a student was allowed to do what their client was denied, and the university is then spending millions in a payment (mostly to those lawyers) as a settlement. Take a catalogue from the 1980s or 1990s (they are online I believe) and every course pretty much has several prerequisites of classes, specific grades, and generally either freshman/soph/jr/sr standing or number of courses in that subject.\\]\\]\n\nBack to the subject, I don't know the complete background, but I think the way it used to be was that MATH 1314 required a placement score -OR- a passing grade in MATH0123, and then that was probably changed to just the placement score. And I bet that is because they got too many students that 'passed' MATH0123 and was still failing out of MATH1314, and with so many online courses where it is incredibly easy to cheat-to-pass, the provost saw this (correctly, IMO) as a major loophole. So, now, they want a good enough placement score, and the MATH0123 is so that students learn enough to get a good enough placement score. And that brings me to my last point.\n\nPassing your classes is NOT the purpose of going to college. Sure, in high school, you can suck air for 4 years, pass, graduate, and any job that wants someone with a high school diploma won't be disappointed in your education. But this is college now. You have to actually learn this stuff. Even if you get a BA in Art History and get hired as a administrative assistant at some dental clinic, that employer will expect a level of math skill when they say a 4 year degree is required. Passing the class is meaningless to them, they need you to work that excel sheet.",

Write down everything, set reminders for every assignment. Do every extra credit opportunity, you never know when you\u2019ll need it. The biggest mistake I see freshman make is thinking that they can manage themselves like they did in highschool. My brother and I are in engineering together, we write down on our apartment\u2019s windows each class we\u2019re taking and beneath that all of the assignments for each class due that week. You\u2019ll easily spend 30 hours a week doing homework. Free time and social time is primarily limited to weekends and odd spurts here and there. This is engineering. There are times when it sucks, when you watch all of your friends go out and have fun while you stay in and do your homework and study. They call CEAT the pre-business school for a reason. The freshman year removes a large amount of people, the sophomore year removes most of the stragglers. You have to want engineering more than anything.

I respect the office that much. I would love to sit with any one of them and have a conversation if given an opportunity.  So I agree with your statement, \"don't be cowards.\"\n\nOklahoma State Baseball could fill that stadium with any former or sitting president. There are enough people like me who respect the office combined with those who would want to see a specific President to fill the stadium in Oklahoma. The stadium only holds about 6k people. I do not personally know Coach Holiday's politics but would imagine that he is able to put politics aside for an event like that.\n\nOklahoma State University I believe would also invite any former or sitting President if they believed that it would help promote the University. I do feel like Universities in the Midwest and South are a little more apt to invite a conservative than those outside of this area. On the flip side, I do not believe that a conservative would be as welcomed outside of the Midwest or South. I may be way off here and am sure that there are many who would disagree with that opinion.\n\nThe people of Oklahoma would likely respond in several ways if a liberal President were to be invited to Oklahoma State. In the same way that in a more liberal area of the country responds when a conservative is invited to speak; there would be many loud folks who would complain loudly. There would be another set of folks who would complain to their family and friends. And then there would be the silent majority who would go on with their lives because politics isn't the only thing they think about and it doesn't drive their daily thoughts. I think that describes how most of the people in our country would respond either way.\n\nTwitter and other social media would flip their lid regardless of which University invites what former or sitting President. \n\nUniversity should be a place that strives to promote \"Unity in Diversity\" no matter what race, color, creed, religion, political party, or world view  you belong to.",

If you are planning on driving, just know that parking at OSU is an absolute nightmare (you have to arrive early to have guaranteed parking). Living walking distance also means you would't have to deal with the bus, which is oftentimes late and/or unpredictable. Relying on the bus also limits when you can go to campus since it isn't running 100% of the time. That being said, plenty of students commute to campus on the bus and it works out just fine for them. Casa Mia is also popular among grad students and I've heard generally positive reviews (can't say the same about The Links lol).",

That scholarship paired with others from the university and the specific college you\u2019ll be joining (CEAT, Agriculture) will take a sizable chunk out of your school bill. You should also receive a pretty nice amount on your Pell Grant if your EFC is zero.  This is basically the path that I took through college (I\u2019ll be graduating in two weeks) and I never had to take out a single loan while receiving no help from my family.

The difference between a Thesis and non-thesis does not matter a lot in the long term in terms of a job doing design work, but it does make for a different college experience. Generally speaking, students that do a thesis get 'more' out of their degree because the thesis requires much more independent hands-on work, writing (which is very important in engineering), and you are just more 'involved' in the department.  \n\nThe other big difference though is the location -- Stillwater is a small town that is focused on the university. UT Arlington is in the middle of the sprawled out Dallas-FortWorth metroplex, so it might take more work there to find the on-campus community. Neither offers any advantage with regards to the job market (a lot of our Mechanical Engineers go to work in the Dallas area).\n\nBoth OSU and UTA have a lot of Indian students (Stillwater has an Indian specialty grocer even).\n\nSo, I'd say UTA wins by giving you a thesis option, but OSU is in a better overall college community.",

Most of the town's rentals are in easy-moderate biking distance and recently there have been more multi story apartment complexes near campus so plenty to choose from at better prices than campus. Rent is generally cheap. \n\nNot part of this questions but I almost always was able to get a teaching assistant position as a domestic student.

I\u2019ll try my best to answer your questions (and feel free to message me if you have more)! \n\n1. You certainly don\u2019t need a car but it can be nice to have. I lived in Stillwater for two years without a vehicle and I was completely fine. I have always lived walking distance from campus and walking distance from several restaurants and a Sprouts for grocery shopping. There is also a bus that is free for students to ride which has routes both around campus and off campus. The bus covers many of the apartment complexes that aren\u2019t walking distance, Walmart and other places you might want to shop/eat at/visit. You should be fine just relying on the bus but a bike can be nice to have as well (so you aren\u2019t limited by what routes are running at a given time). I\u2019m also sure you\u2019ll make friends who have a car, so I wouldn\u2019t worry about transportation! Stillwater is a small town and easy to get around. \n\n2. I never need to leave town. The only time I go to OKC is when I am going to the airport to fly home or want to go to Target (the closest is in Edmond). There are several furniture stores in Stillwater (Aaron\u2019s being the most affordable from personal experience) and Facebook marketplace has A TON of used furniture at an affordable price. I easily furnished my place without leaving Stillwater once. Also if you\u2019re in need of furniture, I\u2019m moving into a furnished place in the fall and will be parting with a lot of my stuff. I\u2019d be happy to send pictures and sell at a low price! \n\n3. Besides the on campus housing you mentioned I don\u2019t know of any housing specifically for grad students. There are a ton of apartment complexes in Stillwater that are very affordable and tend to appeal to the grad student population though. [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/OKState/comments/lq7udp/grad_student_housing_recs/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) is a post with some recommendations! Apple Creek tends to be a popular choice that I\u2019ve heard generally positive things about. \n\n4. I would say the main things to do in Stillwater center around drinking and sports (lol). However, there are tons of other options if those don\u2019t appeal to you. There are lots of choices for outdoor recreation like Boomer lake, Lake Carl Blackwell, the botanic garden and Lake McMurtry. You can kayak, hike, camp or fish (at McMurtry or Carl Blackwell) if those interest you, and the botanic garden/boomer lake are great for just walking around, spending time outside with a pet or friends or for hammocking. The botanic garden also has OSU WiFi, so you can do homework/study outside! There are also several state parks and nature areas within a short drive. If you\u2019re a country music fan then there are a few venues like the Tumbleweed that feature live music from smaller artists and dancing which can be fun. OSU also has the McKnight Center for the Performing Arts which is a brand new venue that hosts more \u201cupscale\u201d performances. They hosted the New York Philharmonic, Cirque du Soleil and a few musicals during their opening season (pre-covid). Tickets are also discounted for students. Additionally, there is an on campus art museum that showcases student works and is free to visit. If none of that appeals to you (or you just want more to do), OSU has over 550 campus organizations so there are bound to be some that interest you. They are a great way to connect with students with common interests and get involved in something outside of class! I\u2019ve been active in several and have made great friends and really enjoyed the experience.",

It runs to most places in town, including downtown. It\u2019s late very frequently. Some parts of Stilly are more bike friendly than others, but a bike would really help. I don\u2019t know any grad students who don\u2019t have a car, but that doesn\u2019t mean it can\u2019t be done. \n\n2) I leave town every week; mostly because my partner lives in Tulsa. Stilly is a nice quaint town, but there\u2019s no question that there is much more culture in OKC and Tulsa. I mean, I went to a Greenwood exhibit in Tulsa this weekend at a museum that used to be an oil baron\u2019s mansion\u2014can\u2019t do that in Stilly. \n\n3) to my knowledge, there aren\u2019t places exclusively for grad students off campus, but if you want fewer rowdy undergrads than look further off campus. I\u2019ve lived in The Links my entire time here, and it\u2019s mostly OSU seniors, grad students, and families. It\u2019s quiet and nice. I pay $705 for a two bed/one bath all to myself. \n\n4) we have a movie theater (AMC), a cute downtown with shops and restaurants, a botanical gardens, community theater, a very active public library, a roller rink, on-campus events (I like the Rocky Horror event that student activities puts on), Homecoming can be fun, Top Golf (actual golf, if you\u2019re into that, my apt. is on a golf course), a welcoming comic and game store, a couple beautiful lakes, and I\u2019m sure some stuff I\u2019m totally missing. In my experience, some campus organizations are a little unfriendly to grad students\u2014I tried really hard to get involved with three different orgs when I moved here and got ghosted pretty hard. \n\nIt can be oppressive if you don\u2019t fit into solidly majority categories. I\u2019ve had friends called various slurs just out and about; you\u2019ll see plenty of confederate flags. It\u2019s red, just like the rest of the state, but OSU\u2019s presence swings it a little closer to center. No place is perfect, and Stilly has some great redeeming qualities.",

I may be in the minority (maybe not; most college students I know really don't care about the strip).  I never could feel any emotional attachment to the bars on the strip. They were gross 20 years ago when I was a student here, they are still gross today. And, \"Historical\" is being generous with all those places -- Yeah yeah, garth brooks first played at Willie's, but that doesn't make the gross bar any less gross.\n\nAnyways, I have been to dozens of college towns and what we have is rather sad -- Our bars look more like stripclubs in the bad part of time. Dark and dank. And the streetscape is completely terrible -- uneven sidewalks, driveways, cutouts, narrow and limited street parking on a narrow street. Go to any Pac12, Big10, ACC school (etc), or heck, even many small private schools in the Midwest, and the bars are much much more open air. Not just patio areas, but like the entire front wall facing the street can raise to bring fresh air into the entire place, and they at least have windows and stuff to draw people in.  And the music is much more varied between places -- places for EDM and techno, country, top40 pop, hard rock, etc. And most have decent beer lists.\n\nAlso, there are usually much more restaurants mixed in, like full service restaurants with good quality food and long beer menus and occassional live music. \n\nAnyways, all told, I think the strip is much too limited space wise. Between the frat houses taking up space on the north end, and the new apartment blocks squeezing them width wise, there just isn't that much square footage.\n\nI think Duck street between Hall of Fame and 6th street (especially between matthews and maple)  should be the targeted zone for a pedestrian friendly entertainment and dining district (with some retail mixed in). It is close to the sports complexes, close to campus still, and close to tons of off campus housing. The road is wide enough but I'd make it 1 lane each direction with bike lanes and central turning lanes (and islands with a few trees). The entire strip has width to require 20-30 foot sidewalks with trees/planters, outdoor seating areas (and/or ID check-in queue lines), and install bike parking and scooter parking. There are nearly full blocks of land already empty in places that can accommodate bigger outdoor/indoor type of venues, tuck in some off street parking (in the back, all the real activity should face the street). Most of the rest of length of the street for about a block in either direction is very old housing that is ripe for tearing down. The churches and the YMCA aren't really in the way either (plenty of buildable space around them to make a cohesive district) and they could charge for late night parking too for those that need/want it. The blocks adjacent to that zone, which also by and large need redeveloped, can then be ripe for new off campus apartment blocks. Then, the sad old strip can just be as it is (if it could compete).",

Call it 1-2 bigger multifamily buildings catering to the more upscale residents and students in the area. Have restaurants, retail, and nicer bars etc on level 1, and have nicer apartments on levels 2 up to however high. Offer nicer amenities than typically available (couple penthouses, rooftop deck/pool). This would be the building block and see what pops up around it in terms of a new district.\n\nI truly think the potential is there to tap into whether it\u2019s younger professors with money or students whose parents have money, even in places like Stillwater.",

        "body": "I think for a real bar and restaurant strip, you don't build apartments directly above it due to noise issues. What you 'typically' see, is a mixture of single story and two level buildings along that strip -- mostly 2-story because restaurants and bars easily make use of the second story for a patio deck and more seating -- with a few buildings a little taller because they can host a few offices or a hotel with sound proofing exterior windows.   Then, the area around that is multi-level apartments with occasional corner convenient stores or take out restaurants. The area all around duck is well suited for such a community and it is the primary 'gap' between campus and downtown. Really, from the heart of campus (the library), the corner of Duck and Elm is about the same distance as  Willie's saloon. And the off campus housing market is both quite large around Duck street -and- underdeveloped. Frats are farther from there than the Strip, of course, and on campus dorms are far from anywhere it seems, but I don't think Duck is 'too far'.\n\nI've long thought about this -- I think main is unneccesarrily farther from campus, and 6th street has to carry too much 'through traffic'  which is semi-truck heavy at times. I think developing that into the center with stoplights and crosswalks every block will gum that up.\n\nAs far as 'can we support it'. That is a big question. But, there is such a thing as 'if you build it, they will come'. Stillwater is close enough to Edmond that we lose a lot of business there which would happily come here if we let it\\*\\*. A lot of faculty and staff and townies happily spend 'going out to eat' money in OKC and Tulsa. A lot of college students just don't go out here because they don't care for the bars we have, but would be excited about going to a dance club playing their favorite music. And who knows how many prospective students (grad students and undergrads) visit town and campus and just get underwhelmed about our off campus offerings.\n\n\\*\\* Case in point -- I ran into faculty, staff, and other Stillwater people at Sprouts in Edmond nearly every trip I made there, before they put a store in Stillwater.",

They began offering an EE/CpE dual degree when I was a junior so I went for it, but some of the CpE courses were honestly 3 courses in one.\n\nYou had lecture, lab, and homework, none of which was directly related. \n\nLecture was its own thing. You listened to the professor talk about abstracts and the state of the industry for a few hours a week.\n\nLab was its own beast. You got vague instructions that required a lot of CS knowledge that you might not necessarily have by that point. My study group would spend 20+ hours a week on the lab alone.\n\nHomework was yet again completely different. You had to read the text and self-teach whatever was mentioned so you could answer a lot of homework questions.\n\nI dropped the CpE option because it was absurdly organized and I felt like I was paying extra money to be tortured by professors and TAs that never did anything to help you unless you spent yet more hours of your life seeking them out and asking them endless questions about things that should have just been covered in the lecture. (But, to their credit, all of them were usually willing to patiently sit and help you for however long it took you to get it.)\n\nI do think that if you can put in the huge number of hours required to succeed and you do make it through the degree, you'll be better equipped than most just because it does force you to teach yourself 80% of the subject matter through trial and error.",

I recommend making use of winter intercession or summer courses to help cut down on your hours in the main semesters. You can get a lot of your GenEd courses (Comp I, Government, Survey of American History) and electives out of the way like that. I especially recommend doing Government over the winter intercession, that was one of the easiest classes I have taken.\n\nAs for during the semesters proper: don't skip class. Some professors might still have their courses broadcast online, but I recommend going in person so you can focus better. Do as much work as you can as soon as you can. You're pretty much always going to have something to work on, so try to make sure that you get something done every day. However, if you're getting burnt out on things, you can take a break for a while. Not having any time for yourself will burn you out hard.",

If you have a 2 hour gap between classes go to the library and knock out some homework or study for an upcoming quiz. Class done at 2pm? Great!

It was the largest room, but since it had two desks and two beds it was cramped. I did not have a wardrobe, but a \"closet\" (indent in the wall) and a dresser. The dresser had 3 (I think) very large drawers and didn't have an issue with not enough space. Then again I didn't have many clothes to begin with. My friend who stayed on the third floor did have a wardrobe and from what I can recall, it wasn't all that big. Bennett hall wasn't all that bad. One gripe I do have is the seemingly always broken washer or dryers. Granted this was 2016 so I'm hoping they fixed them. If you have anymore questions, feel free to drop me a message!",

Our BOD (students who make us events) keeps coming up with fun activities- this semester we\u2019ve already made mardis gras masks, had free ice cream and pie, had an instructor-led painting party, and made slime for St. Patrick\u2019s. In the fall we even managed to have our traditional Halloween party with costume contest. Famous in-person events of yore included two-stepping night (where you could learn the famous line dances even if you didn\u2019t know already) and movie nights in our special basement movie lounge. \n\nPlus there\u2019s the regular lounges- two on every floor (except one on the fourth floor with its single rooms), each with a tv and full kitchen. There\u2019s pool tables and foosball and air hockey, along with couches and tables. This is my third year here and many\u2019s the night I spent from getting off class till going to bed just chilling, talking with whoever and everyone who came by, or playing DnD late into the night. We\u2019d go hard for homecoming events, put together groups to attend campus events all at once, even making a pilgrimage to football games in time to be the first ones in the gates and stake out the first couple rows right behind the goal posts. \n\nEdited to add: last fall when Among us was a craze we\u2019d get on a discord someone made to play and if someone killed you in a particularly dastardly/hilarious way, you\u2019d walk over and tape a rock on their door. This is possibly the most on-brand Stout can get lol\n\nIf you\u2019re not afraid to be called a nerd, Stout is the way.",

You are expected to be in studio a minimum of 12 hours a week, but realistically I spend at least 20-30 hours a week in studio, on top of my other classes. In theory, it is possible for you to commute, but I think it would take a serious mental toll on a student. You\u2019d probably be better off transferring to Stillwater. Best of luck",

I say that mainly from the fact that the class schedules and availability per semester are so rigid (8 Studio classes and you can only take one a semester).  Basically, by doing gen eds first you could've added time to your total time in college.  This is a worst-case scenario and very unlikely for you, so don't freak out, contact Suzanne. \n\nAs for 1 or 2 times a week in Stillwater, best of luck with that.  Not sure on Covid has affected the classes but for me the first 6 studios I had were MWF 1-5pm.  The final two studios you'll take are 5 days a week 1-5pm.   I did have a classmate who lived in Tulsa and would commute so I will say it is possible, but you'll be spending a lot more time in Stillwater than you realize.\n\nI graduated a while back so not all of this will be perfectly up to date but I can't imagine it changing all that much.  Again contact Suzanne Bilbeisi or whoever is the architectural academic advisor. ()",

They would stay with friends overnight in Stillwater for the big deadlines. Even if classes are now offered with a hybrid virtual component, I would highly recommend physically going to class and working on projects in Studio. There\u2019s no cutting corners in this major, and the chances of you being successful are much, much greater the more you are in Studio. You learn from your peers and the students in other studios just as much, if not more, than from your professors. If I were you, I\u2019d take all my classes at the Stillwater campus because failing a studio can delay your graduation an entire year. Living outside of Stillwater for the architecture program is very risky. It can be done, but you will struggle juggling a commute.",

Also contacting financial aid may help answer that but they may not know for sure since they may not actually apply it. It\u2019s it\u2019s a university waiver then it\u2019s up to the office that actually applies and grants the waivers. Hope that helps.

The reality is that with a receiver like Justin Blackmon it didn't matter how far he could throw because Blackmon was always open and would dominate defenders even if he was covered. It helped that the defense was consistently good throughout his career as well.\n\nSwitch Rudolph with Weeden on their respective peak rosters. What would happen is Weeden would never be able to complete a pass because Rudolph's o line was sorry and Weeden would never move to evade pressure. Rudolph would have won the Heisman with a receiver like Justin Blackmon, or maybe Blackmon would've won it with a QB like Rudolph. Weeden was good for the time but his style of play quickly became obsolete and it showed in his performance in the NFL.",

Traditional dorms are usually two people in a room with community bathrooms. At OSU the traditional dorms are Iba, Parker, Stout, Wentz, and University Commons which are 3 separate buildings. The commons are only a few years old so they\u2019re by far the nicest but they\u2019re all going to be fairly similar. They\u2019re all fairly close to campus as well, so the walk isn\u2019t bad. Parker is also only for freshman, so everyone would be new to campus like your son. \n\nA step up from traditional dorms would be a suite which has a bathroom in the unit rather than community bathrooms. These include Bennett, Patchin/Jones, Zink/Allen and the villages. These (with the exception of the villages) are generally farther from campus. Bennett is quite a long walk which is why people say to avoid it. The villages are also specific to colleges within OSU. So your son would live with people with a similar/the same major. This is a great way to get to know future classmates. \n\nI lived in a suite as a freshman which I really enjoyed. I became really good friends with my roommates but we didn\u2019t really have a community within the dorm. I never really got to know people outside of my room.

Plus the ability to meet tons of new people is far better IMO in a traditional dorm hall. I always recommend a traditional dorm experience first. If privacy is an absolute must then suites are great options too. Good luck and go pokes.",

This way, he can find people he wants to live with (on or off campus), and even if he doesn't there are other options to explore after freshman year. \n\nAny of the housing areas that I would've said to avoid are luckily closed down now, so really anywhere is a good option to start but traditional is the best to feel things out.

I think Bennet is as good as any other place overall, but if your son is really into sports, I'd recommend something closer to the Colvin Center and intramural fields (like the north commons).  \n\n Unfortunately, OSU has placed dorms in three very different directions, so when it comes to on-campus/meal plan food, there is no real way to win. When I was a student a couple decades ago, we'd walk to Bennett (from Parker) a lot for food during the week because they had some of the best options, and Bennett kids would walk to the Parker/Scott/Wentz dining area a lot for what was then a nice lunch/breakfast buffet and dinner option -- the dining scene keeps changing, but what remains the same is that students want variety and with spaced out housing, the options for food are also spaced out.  For easy walking to places -off campus-, North Commons is by far the farthest from anything in town --  OSU does the town no favors by placing so much on campus housing so far from commercial districts.  \n\nI would recommend staying away from the on campus apartments/suites  -- it is much easier to make friends in traditional dorm settings than in the apartments.",

If you're going to live there you either need to bring a bike or get comfortable with the bus (Bennett is one of the few places on campus that it's actually faster to take a bus to most classes than it is to walk).\n\nProximity to on campus food is also a bit of a problem because North Dining is about 3/4 of a mile away. It's a bit tough to just hop over and meet a friend there for a bite to eat when you have to say \"give me half an hour to get ready and powerwalk over there.\" Plus, it's still just about the closest place to eat on campus when the weekend comes around because the small restaurant in Bennett is closed from before dinner friday all the way until breakfast Monday. Even Bennett's convenience store is closed on weekends (except for a couple hours Sunday nights).\n\nWith all the negatives come the positives, though. I actually really enjoyed Bennett. The rooms are nice and, at least when I lived there, there seemed to always be something going on in the basement or the volleyball court or something. I made a lot of friends there.",

I toured it a few times during that and have pictures of completely blank interior floors from window to window before the rebuilding. The construction of these interior walls was done then. What you have isn't anything to do with the age of the bricks on the outside, and everything to do with OSU Res Life doing the bare minimum in construction costs on these dorms. The original construction was likely much better with regards to sound transfer! Anyways, I just want to clarify for the record -- Places like Stout and Bennet are newer in every real regard than the tradiational dorms like Parker or even some of the north apartments (like Morsani Smith /Zinc Allen).

There\u2019s concentrations that will take you down a more technical path or down a more security centered path (what I\u2019m doing) or you can choose to take neither and just continue on taking the regular curriculum, which is a good mix of both!\n\nFor a lot of people in the MIS program, your hardest class will most likely take place early on, being a database class with professor Burkman! I\u2019m not trying to scare you, but I think maybe a third of people in my class didn\u2019t pass. It\u2019s easy if you catch on quick, but if not, you\u2019ll need to study and ask a lot of questions. The class goes quick, but Burkman is a great guy and he is the supervisor for ISAC! \n\nISAC is a club that you definitely need to join as an MIS major. It pretty much covers information security stuff that\u2019s going on, but ISAC is where you can join teams for hackathons that happen every year. During our last meeting, we covered how to setup a NAT network for virtual machines, which is great because you\u2019ll take a class later on that you build a network literally from the ground up!\n\nI\u2019ve been rambling a lot, but if you have more questions, I\u2019m here and my DMs are open!",

It's putting the onus on the students without power to appeal to their professors while they deal with other problems, and it's putting more work on professors as they have to deal with a cascading number of students reaching out to them with these problems.\n\nThe university could avoid all of that and just tell professors to record their lectures and push back due dates, quizzes, and exams to next week at the earliest. Asynchronous teaching is the solution to asynchronous power outages.\n\n(PS: I'm actually surprised if OSU/Stillwater is seeing blackouts because OSU has its own generator building.

I worked with a professor over climate policy and she taught me everything I would need to know and more about the scientific process concerning the political science field. You\u2019ll learn about policy and there are lots of great classes about specific types, ie drug policy, IR, environmental policy, etc. These classes are really beneficial, but I would say you need to find a way to supplement the statistical analysis portion of the degree. This part is extremely important if you plan on pursuing any higher degrees. If you\u2019re hoping for political commentator you\u2019ll most likely need a higher degree after your BA, which is where connections in the field are important. If you find a mentor professor they can help get your name on research as an undergrad and refer you to programs based on that. Basically, you\u2019ll get out what you put in. There are plenty of opportunities to get involved and any professor would be willing to work with you outside of university political science organizations.",

If you don't mind adding 10-15 minutes to your drive, you can make it out to OKC, which has an even better selection of arts-related activities & good restaurants.

When I first moved to Stillwater it was a bit of a liberal college town oasis in the middle of rural-conservative Oklahoma.

However, there are other places but idk really what you mean by \"arts\" if you want to expand on that I could help with that.  Restaurant wise, remember how I described it as a suburb, well suburbs are known for their chain resturants, and Stillwater is pretty much no different.  There is only one place that I've got to say I love and can't find anything that'll beat it in Austin.  That is Hideaway Pizza, for future reference they're not a chain, the one in Stillwater is the one and only the others are a knockoff chain called Hideaway2.\n\nNot sure where you'd be coming from to Stillwater but realize you'll put miles on a car to travel to OKC or Tulsa (~65 miles one way) since that's where you'll have to do shopping for things if you're looking for really nice things, since Stillwater doesn't have a mall.",

Tickets are fairly cheap as well, especially to get season tickets. There are more performing arts options than I have time to take advantage of.\n\nRestaurants, not so much. Stillwater has a few 'okay' places to go out and eat (one decent sushi place, one decent asian fusion place, Tokyo pot is neat for some Japanese hotpot, we have a decent place to carry out some Indian food, but almost everything is suburban chain lowest common denominator restaurants (outsized portions to make up for low quality ingredients prepared in ways to be edible, but not exciting). Even for quick lunches, unless you like sandwhiches, burgers, or fried chicken (so much goddam chicken places), you won't find things like a good Ramen place, sushi bowl place (the place we have wants to soak your entire meal in mayo, and the fish quality is not good), taco place (Fuzzy's is overrated guys) (etc). And \"The Hideaway Pizza\" in Stillwater is bad compared to the \"Hideaway Pizza\" places in Tulsa and OKC. The best restaurants that have come over the last couple decades seem to shut down before you even have a chance to try out much on their menu.\n\nTulsa and OKC has a few good places too. but there still isn't a 'foodie' scene anywhere in Oklahoma close to what you will find on other parts of the country. You can't even find Dim-Sum in the entire state of Oklahoma outside of I think two (yes, just two) places that do it only during certain hours of the week.

OSU has always had a conservative element due to the Ag college, it is and has long been probably the most republican (or one of the most republican) large state schools in the country.

It has gone to a \"I am a republican because I hold conservative (religious and/or fiscal and/or national security) values\" to \"I am a republican because I am rural\" and they really lean into the so called 'culture wars' where they think they need to protect and project a rural identity to fight  ''em lib-rals'. The GOP doesn't even have a political identity anymore - last August it became \"we support Trump\" -- it is purely a cultural and social identity.  \n\nSocial media (facebook especially) has warped what it used to mean to becoming of age. Students don't have the hard social- reset and between high school and college to feel safe exploring things outside of how they were raised.",

You may pay 10K a semester but the state of Oklahoma is paying pennies on the dollar for your education than what the state of Oklahoma paid for my education. The Republicans and the GOP have been purposefully defunding OSU since the 1980s on a per-student basis. Every opportunity when there was a budget issue, they cut higher ed first and the deepest. And when the money was rolling in later, they gave tax breaks to the rich. After about 8 cycles of this, you get to go bankrupt going to college so that the state's millionaires can buy lakehouses and boats on the money they didn't have to pay on state capital gains taxes, oil taxes, and income taxes. The classes you take with 400 students, used to have no more than 50 students, and the upper division courses would have about 20 students. The departments you go to for help used to have 8 staff members to assist students and faculty, and now they are down to 1-4 staff to deal with everything they used -AND- all of the IT issues -AND- all of the (GOP -passed legislation) that requires accounting for every penny and hour of effort on every state dime and research grant. And you all are relatively lucky, OSU's tuition remains well below its competition because OSU, unlike other schools, has been careful about over-budgeting, brings in tons of income on extensions services (and a decent amount on research), and underpays its staff especially bad (and some faculty a little). \n\n Back on topic, look - Covid sucks, It especially sucks for the lab courses, all of my sympathies are with you all, but if you CAN take a in person class then you should just do so and stop expecting the course to be spoon fed you on Canvas. If you can't, realize that distance learning existed in the 1990s too, and what students did then was BUY A TEXTBOOK, learn everything according to a lesson plan from it, turned in homework (by mail, or dropping off on campus at the distance learning office). They didn't get online lectures, notes, slides, office hours/conferences, discussion forums etc etc etc. You are all lucky to get everything you get, don't forget that. You aren't owed a syllabus the first day of the semester on Canvas so you can make a decision on whether to drop a class without having to get out of bed this week.",

In my department, we have a good grad student society that has a ton of friendly masters and doctorate students who are always willing to answer questions from newbies. We have a facebook group with the primary purpose for grad students to find answers and post about housing options. Check with your future advisor to see if they are aware for contact info on your grad student society.

It was a very basic overview of python. I learned enough to understand what python was but not much more. We had a week in recursion, defining classes and what object oriented programming was but weren\u2019t expected to be 100% invested in learning any of it. I honestly couldn\u2019t do much with python afterwards. Still a decent intro class though if you want to learn the basics. However, keep in my mind you still have to put in some work, just don\u2019t expect to know how to write \npython scripts that are very complicated or useful afterwards. \n\nI then took FIN 4550 - Intro to Financial Analysis with Python. This was where I learned the most on actually using python with real life examples using time series stock data, financial returns, probability, option trading, etc... We did about 90 percent of all the analysis using the Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, and Yfinance libraries. I found this class much more interesting and felt like I learned skills much more relevant to my goals, which include Data Analysis. You don\u2019t need prior programming experience for this class, but it moves very fast. So prior experience helps.\n\nJust my 2 cents.",

I live from another city in Oklahoma currently which is over an hour away since I thought that it would be nice to feel more independent and have my own life outside of everything i\u2019m familiar with now. As for the atmosphere, I fell in love with it when I visited the famous months ago. The design of the buildings, the different demographics for students, and a lot of little things mentioned through my visit had me excited to think about what kind of experience I could have at this college as opposed to other ones. I am going to be attending the Spears Business School, which was the building that grabbed my attention the strongest on campus. Hearing about the kind of collaboration that was promoted at the college and seeing the rooms and achievements that have been done in the building really pulled me in. \n\nMy only complaint so far (having not actually attended the school yet) would probably be that the merchandise doesn\u2019t really have anything without that orange on it, but i\u2019ll probably grow to get used to that even. \n\nFrom reading other posts on this subreddit, it seems to come down to the atmosphere for most people if that\u2019s what they\u2019re looking for. OSU seems to be more chill and fun while OU is more about academics and prestige, from what people say. That saying solidified my choice as I came upon it multiple times and didn\u2019t want to recreate my high school experience of doing well academically but not having a ton of fun too often. \n\nHopefully that helps a little?",

I got involved in the OSU BCM\u2019s on campus ministry & I met my husband there too. \nI will say that hireosugrads.com is a great website and resource for recruiters to find you and hire you. I graduated in May of 2020 and had and accepted a job offer in Feb 2020. I love my job right now. I had plenty of friends get job offers all over USA. Hope that helps :)",

OU is prestigious in Oklahoma and literally nowhere else. OSU has a few programs rated higher academically, but it's not thought of as the more academic school between the two because of its ag heritage.\n\nAs far as weighing OSU and OU in terms of how it will impact your chances of getting into more prestigious grad schools, it won't make a difference. The only exception might be OU Med or OU Law preferring OU students, but OSU Med exists (although not for M.D. students) and if OU Law won't let you in, either work on your LSAT and go somewhere like Baylor, SMU, or UT, or Tulsa or OCU will likely accept you.",

        "body": "For the most part, yeah, people at OU do consider it a more prestigious school. This is mostly associated with the bigger brand recognition due to the football program, but it is just incorporated into their 'identity'. You will find this in many other states where there is a traditional \"ag\" school that attracts down to earth friendly students (Michigan State, Auburn, Kansas State, Miss State etc), and the other school attracts a lot of students that want to (falsely) claim prestige (Michigan, Alabama, Kansas, Ole Miss). That alone creates a different atmosphere on campus because you are attracting something innate about the students' personalities. But, on just about any metric, none of this prestige stuff pans out in the numbers in these schools on the whole. Admissions requirements and acceptance rates are very similar on paper (and identical in practice). If you look at any program that OU and OSU have in common (engineering, business, and arts and sciences), the two schools are in statistically identical rankings, taking turns who is ahead. Both schools have scooped faculty from time to time from the other school (a pursuit that never really pays off for either school). The two schools enjoy similar amounts of research funding success, patents, etc. OU has a bigger endowment, but a lot of the difference is athletics related (and the rest easily has to do completely with the uniqueness of having Law and medical schools at OU)\n\nTo note, Oklahoma gives equal funding to both OSU and OU and neither is seen as the 'flagship' public university over the other (this differs to states like Minnesota and California, where the UMN and UCal schools are indeed flagships with incredibly more investment and resources, higher admissions requirements, etc. than Minnesota State and Cal State). The main differences academically is that OSU as a large ag school, and OU have professional Law and Medical schools. Behind the scenes though, OSU has enjoyed better governance than OU administratively, and is financially on much more solid ground than OU. OU is a bit more bloated in terms of too many faculty and too few students in several departments, which drags the whole institution down a bit. OSU's income side is much more diverse overall due to the extension programs as well. Overall, OSU spreads scholarship support more broadly, while OU focuses theirs more deeply on fewer students (their whole 'national merit' thing). \n\nI went to OSU (a few decades ago) because of the same reasons everyone else put here. It is just more welcoming, supportive, and gives better scholarships.",

Homecoming is always a blast (when covid wasn\u2019t around), and football games are a great day to have with friends (and family, if applicable).\n\nThe education is above average I would say.

        "body": "Well, the program is pretty well respected in the field. We have some great professors in the higher level classes. Sadly a couple have moved on since I had them, but there are still several great ones. If you're interested, its possible to get a degree in both Mechanical Engineering and Aerospace Engineering for only 9 hours more than the Mechanical degree alone. They recently made some restructures to the curriculum (for the better in my opinion). They've just put in a new lab called Endeavor in an effort to make the curriculum even more hands and experience based than it already was. Some of the early general engineering courses can be kind of a pain, but they are important and there is plenty of options for help in place so its very possible to do well in them. Some classes (like chemistry) will be taught with the purpose to weed out people who can't handle the pressure. Stick with it, don't be discouraged, use the help resources, and you'll do just fine.\n\nThere are tons of research opportunities and I knew lots of people who worked for a professor fairly early on, like sophomore year. You'll have to not be afraid to ask around the department, but many people are looking for research assistants. There are also several clubs that you can be involved with that give good experience like the Baja club where they build their own racing vehicle and then take it to compete with others.\n\nI'm not entirely sure what you mean by campus placements, but if you mean the location of your classes it isn't bad and it's definitely possible to make it from one classroom to almost any other that you'll be in within a reasonable amount of time. The only place that really bugged me was a lot of engineering courses are held in what used to be a dorm cafeteria thats pretty far from the center of campus, but still reachable.\n\nOverall it's a great university and a great experience. Coursework is important, but also don't forget to do some fun stuff like going to home football/basketball/etc games joining some clubs and stuff like that.",

I loved the long walk to class because it allowed me to have lots of time to myself. However, I never got to know a single person in the building. I went to a few of the events and still did not get to know anyone. I moved to Village D at semester because I wanted to be closer to everything on campus. Bennett is super far from the Colvin and basically everything else. On days that I had classes, I left my room half an hour before class started and basically stayed on campus until night because I dreaded walking back. When I was at Bennett, I found it difficult to get the motivation to go places because I did not want to walk both ways. I am not a huge football fan, so the gameday closeness never helped me. I personally would try my hardest to never live in Bennett again. (I also had mold in my room and the maintenance people just painted over it pretending that that would solve everything. The carpets are also pretty gross.) I am in the honors college, but I did not join the LLP. If you have any questions, feel free to ask!",

And additionally if a student tests positive for covid-19 and has to quarantine (and provides proper documentation to the professor) then the missed class periods cannot be counted against them.\n\nI obviously can\u2019t speak to the specific class in question but yeah a professor can grade you on attendance unless you have a documented reason for not being able to attend.

And we\u2019re just not necessarily set up to have pick-and-choose options.\n\n>\t\u201cWhat I would say, and I think we have, is encouraging our faculty to have grace with our students, to work with them in terms of how to best proceed. I encourage our students to talk with their faculty and develop a plan if they feel like they need that.\u201d\n\n[Full video from mental health Q&A](https://news.okstate.edu/articles/communications/2020/mental-health-qa-addresses-student-questions-highlights-resources.html)",

        "body": "1.) You\u2019ll have to figure that out through rushing. Take your time to meet as many fraternities as possible, make sure to talk to guys at the events. They will boast and lie about things to sell themselves to you so just take most of the things they say with a grain of salt. Top houses on campus are usually considered to be SNU, Fiji, Sig Chi, Beta\n\n2.) Go online and register with IFC, it\u2019s usually pretty quick and it gets your name and info in their rush data base. If you have friends or know guys in Greek life, talk to them about getting in contact with their rush chairs.\nNot all fraternities do spring rush which will leave you with less choices (Fiji and SNU are 2 houses that never do a spring rush), but you\u2019d probably fit in a little better because you rushed as a freshman. If you wait till the fall, you might have more options but could feel out of place in a PC due to being older than most of the fall guys.\n\n3.) It consists of being active in Greek life, going through pledgeship, being involved with your fraternity and brotherhood. We have one of the best Greek life\u2019s in the US so it\u2019s worth rushing here if you can. Money wise it\u2019s cheaper to be in a Greek house than it is to live in campus housing with a meal plan so there\u2019s that too\n\nEdit: once your name is in the data base, every rush chair will be able to see your info, gpa, etc and will contact you if they feel like rushing you",

I went as a freshmen going into my sophomore year and had a great experience. You get the chance to meet a ton of different people from each house on campus. This allows you to have your options instead of being limited to just the fraternities that do spring rush. \n\nWith that being said, I made a handful of amazing friends that I would not have otherwise met if I did not join the fraternity I did. This was only a small fraction of the people in the fraternity so for another suggestion, check out [campuslink.okstate.edu](https://campuslink.okstate.edu) you can search in the search bar for specific interests and see if anything comes up in terms of student organizations that exist on campus. you could also email [campuslife@okstate.edu](mailto:campuslife@okstate.edu) and state your interests and they could push you into the right direction in terms of orgs on campus. \n\nYou can also go to events, virtual or otherwise, and connect with others that way as well. There are many ways to connect with others at OSU I think you just have to put yourself out there and find your niche.",

        "body": "Okay this is such a hard question so I had to pick a top 3, even though I could honestly give you more. All of the jerseys have the custom paisley around the collar and sleeves. Some of the helmets do too but I feel like you can\u2019t really appreciate those little details while watching the game. I\u2019m a big believer that we have the best unis in the conference and top three in the country (but obviously I\u2019m a little biased). \n\n1) My all time favorite is any combo with the [orange chrome helmet](https://twitter.com/osuathletics/status/551199117708255232?s=21). People hate on it for being \u201ctoo much\u201d, but I\u2019m willing to fight to the death over it because I think they are [masterpieces. ](https://twitter.com/kococarson/status/515284682301136896?s=21)\n\n2) The Thurman Thomas [throwbacks](https://mobile.twitter.com/CowboyFB/status/1308556690304847872?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1308556690304847872%7Ctwgr%5Eshare_3&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fnews.sportslogos.net%2F2020%2F09%2F25%2Foklahoma-state-cowboys-unveil-1987-throwback-uniforms%2Fcollege%2F) from the West Virginia game this year were outstanding. A perfect recreation of the 1987 Sun Bowl unis that he played his last game in for the day he got inducted to the ring of honor. \n\n3) The matte black helmet/white jersey/and orange pants [combo](https://pistolsfiringblog.com/where-bedlam-2018-ranks-among-most-thrilling-in-mike-gundy-era/) has to be #3. We\u2019ve done that color combo quite a few times with different black helmets and it always looks sharp. I know we wore that look for bedlam 2018. \n\nHonorable mentions go to the 2019 [Veterans Day](https://twitter.com/cowboyfb/status/1193657601667538944?s=21) look, 2018 homecoming [Barry Sanders ](https://www.uniswag.com/blog/ok-state-barry-sanders-throwbacks)throwback and to the [icy white helmets. ](https://twitter.com/cowboyfb/status/660512825123586048?s=21)",

Its a great and valuable degree but its useless if you get into the 4+1 program at OSU or even getting the regular MBA.\n\nInstead of getting an MBA OSU, people should go work in a company post undergrad, get promoted atleast once or twice, go get an MBA from a reputed university ( top 30 schools)\n\nMy whole argument is the fact that students enroll into these 4+1 programs at OSU and end up not having a job or any work experience and struggle to find something. 99% of MBA grads have work experience and employers expect the same. On the other hand if you enroll in the 4+1 program you firstly can't get any MBA job and so you'll opt for a low end analyst position that only requires a bachelors degree and that too will be hard coz employers have a set salary range for MBAs and will not pay you for a job that only requires a Bachelors degree \n\nYou're whole argument is way off from what I said.",

I was told they would be sanitizing all classrooms at least once a day and using a fog machine type sanitization method between classes. One of my classes ran late once and I realized they were not sanitizing between classes, as the students from the next class came in and sat down. I am in the first class to be in my classroom for the day, and once I found crumbs still on the desk. That leads me to believe there is no sanitization of desks going on like I was told there would be. I think OSU needs to address this and be truthful about what sanitization they are doing. If students know, they can take their own measures and sanitize their desks themselves if they want to. \n\nThank you for doing this. It feels very empowering to know when faculty are on our side and to have you fight for us.",

        "body": "First off, thank you from the bottom of my heart. I have reached out many times to the university, but am treated as the little annoying nat that also happens to pay $20k a year. \nHere are some of my notes from this semester \n\n1) I was one of the concerned students in twitter asking for the above mentioned post over the two girls to be taken down. It took over 24 hours for the university to respond. I was also harassed in the comments by hateful individuals and one of my friends was sexually harassed in the comments. I can still access those comments, though the post is removed. OSU students were openly having a field day taking each other down. \n\n2) I only attended my in person class once this semester. Upon walking in the room, the seats were 3ft apart, but were shielded on three sides with clear plexiglass to prevent contamination. The majority of the class immediately took their masks off. Even though we have assigned seating, if classrooms get cleaned once a day, that\u2019s about a dozen students, who weren\u2019t required to wear masks, contaminating the desk area with droplets during their entire class period. If I went to any more classes, the contamination would be exponential and impossible to contract trace. I have a immunocompromised roommate, so of course I have no written statement that I personally can not attend mandatory classes, and have suffered to keep my roommate safe. We live off campus and signed our lease in January. When students walk out of buildings, they also take off their masks despite still being in large crowds, not socially distanced. There\u2019s nothing stopping students from being mask less on OSU walking paths, and two passing students get within inches of each other with no protection. \n\n3) During one of my Physics labs, the physical science building had the fire alarm go off. The first responders were a few police officers. 2 officers were not wearing masks, 1 was. They walked past students from my lab who had taken off their masks and did not enforce the mask policy. It took over ten minutes for the fire department to arrive. 1 of the firefighters was not wearing a mask. I tweeted this information at okstate and they said they\u2019ll look into it. I have not been updated. \n\n4) Myself and my close friends are not even sure how many students have committed suicide. The only reason we started finding out was because of the instance that happened at the fraternity house, as that story was publicized. I feel like OSU is covering up these tragedies as I can\u2019t find information to confirm 3 or 4 students have taken their lives this semester. It\u2019s okstates job to protect these students, and the first step is to be truthful. Awareness can make all of the difference. We need education on mental health more than ever in this catastrophe of a year.\n\nEdit: do you intend to keep this thread updated? I think it would be great to see the revisions you\u2019ve commented about and to get the link after you finish it",

It adds risk to have the student body leave for a week (to wherever) and come back. However, not having a break in the spring semester at all will be VERY taxing.

I'm sure that applies to many other students.\n\nIf anything, I'd prefer to leave a week earlier than start a week later. Either way, not having spring break is going to have a negative affect.\n\nI'm grateful that you're listening and want to help students! It means a lot, especially after the statements made by VP of Student Affairs.",

According to the Psychological Services Center (S. Murray Hall), they have three additional on-campus counselors. However, these services are not free, but operate on a sliding scale barring many students from accessing them. Counseling and Counseling Psychology Clinic has around fourteen additional counselors, several of them working purely as intake counselors. Further, none of these fourteen are (per the dept itself) accredited. They also serve not only OSU students, but the local community. Students receive four free visits, and then a sliding scale fee applies, still barring many students from access. One psychiatrist at Grand Lake Mental Health Center is contracted with OSU, but also serves the wider community, and services are not free. MD Live offers OSU students five free visits over the phone, but charges $99/visit after. A Mercy Crisis Hotline is available in addition to the standard suicide hotline, but these services, while useful, do not enable students in crisis to establish stable relationships with counselors, which is critical to mental health treatment.\n\nOSU is failing its students in regards to mental-health. Services are available, but are not sufficiently accessible. Students in crisis are not receiving the help they need, and the university is not directing them to substantive mental health care outside of the university. Again, this was an entirely predictable turn of events, and OSU had plenty of time to prepare for it.",

If anyone has anything you want added, please let me know. I will revise and post this on [Change.org](https://Change.org), as well as sending around for other faculty to sign.  \n\n\n> Despite promises from the administration, students at Oklahoma State University (OSU) are suffering greatly.   \n  \n>  \n>Currently, there are several issues going unaddressed.  \n  \n>  \n>First, OSU has refused, despite pleas from students, to implement a Pass/Fail option for Fall 2020. We feel that there is no justifiable reason to refuse to allow a Pass/Fail option. Citing \"academic integrity\" (as VP of Student Affairs Doug Hallenbeck has) and negative impact on scholarships, transfers and applications to jobs or further schooling is insufficient justification for several reasons. (1) A Pass/Fail option is optional, and only affects students who freely choose it. (2) Scholarships, applications and academic integrity are not nearly as valuable as student well-being. (3) There are no clear or definite reasons to think that applications to jobs or educational programs would be significantly affected by some students taking a Pass/Fail grade; educational institutions and employers should understand that COVID-19 has caused widespread suffering and adjust their expectations accordingly. Finally, a petition for a Pass/Fail grading option has received over 6,000 signatures as of Oct. 22, 2020, which is roughly 1/4th of all students at OSU.  \n  \n>  \n>[https://www.ocolly.com/news/petition-for-pass-no-pass-grading/article\\_5fc2ba46-02ca-11eb-b8a7-e7cbfa49f1d2.html](https://www.ocolly.com/news/petition-for-pass-no-pass-grading/article_5fc2ba46-02ca-11eb-b8a7-e7cbfa49f1d2.html)  \n[https://ktul.com/news/local/3-osu-students-take-their-own-lives-students-want-change](https://ktul.com/news/local/3-osu-students-take-their-own-lives-students-want-change)  \n[https://www.change.org/p/oklahoma-state-university-change-osu-grading-policy-to-pass-fail-for-fall-2020?signed=true](https://www.change.org/p/oklahoma-state-university-change-osu-grading-policy-to-pass-fail-for-fall-2020?signed=true)  \n  \n>  \n>Second, OSU COVID guidelines are (a) insufficient to protect students and (b) not well enforced nor implemented. Additionally, (c) OSU has not made health-services widely available and accessible to students sick with COVID-19. (a) Current OSU guidelines are insufficient in that students are allowed to return to dorms while still symptomatic, and the criteria for return to dorms is far too vague and subjective to be useful. Current OSU criteria for return to campus is 10 days from start of symptoms, improvement in symptoms, and lack of fever. However, due to the inherent difficulty of gauging one's own improvement, and the unpredictability of COVID-19 progression, this leaves too much up to fallible student judgement, and puts roommates, students and faculty/staff at risk. (b) Further, it is not clear that there is any detailed contact-tracing on campus. There appears to be symptomatic students, who are likely still contagious, returning to campus and shared-living spaces. (b) Additionally, there are reports from students who have tested positive for COVID-19, or who have had a roommate test positive for COVID-19, and been refused aid from the university. One student in particular claimed that \"when my studio was affected by COVID, the university left us on our own.\" Though the university has promised to arrange separate rooms for those who test positive, this is not always happening. Currently, though the CDC and University recommendations are aligned, the University should be playing it safe and not allowing students to return to campus housing nor in-person classes without medical evaluation or further testing. Especially since OSU faculty/staff and students are not notified of positive test results. (c) Multiple students have reported to faculty that, once quarantined for a positive COVID-19 test, University Health Services (UHS) have not reached out to them to check on their symptoms. Further, multiple students have reported to faculty that, though they were significantly ill, they were not advised on how/where to seek treatment, and that, upon calling UHS, they were not able to get a prompt virtual appointment. This is especially scary for students who are not from the area, as they have no established physician in Stillwater, and because the Stillwater Hospital is currently at or near COVID ICU capacity as of Oct. 15th, 2020.  \n  \n>  \n>[https://go.okstate.edu/admissions/covid-19.html](https://go.okstate.edu/admissions/covid-19.html)  \n[https://go.okstate.edu/coronavirus/faq/index.html#Housing](https://go.okstate.edu/coronavirus/faq/index.html#Housing)  \n[https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/end-home-isolation.html](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/end-home-isolation.html)  \n[https://www.stillwater-medical.org/node/737](https://www.stillwater-medical.org/node/737)  \n  \n>  \n>Third, OSU failed to prepare for the predictable mental health crises on campus. Currently, OSU mental health services is backed up, and appointments are booked out as far as 6 months (according to students who self-reported to faculty). An alarmingly high number of students are reporting suicidal thoughts or inclination to self-harm to faculty members. OSU has stated that, though there is a long wait for counseling appointments, students in urgent need of a counselor will be seen quickly. However,  students have reported to faculty that, upon calling University Counseling Services, they have been shrugged off, or simply told to seek help by calling the suicide prevention hotline. It appears that students are not receiving the help they need, and that the University is not directing them to substantive mental health care outside of the university. Again, this was an entirely predictable turn of events, and OSU had plenty of time to prepare for it.  \n  \n>  \n>Between 3 and 4 OSU students have committed suicide since August 2020. Initial reports were of 3 suicides since August 2020, however, multiple students have reported an additional suicide to faculty which is going unreported.  \n  \n>  \n>[https://ucs.okstate.edu/scc/index.html](https://ucs.okstate.edu/scc/index.html)  \n[https://ktul.com/news/local/3-osu-students-take-their-own-lives-students-want-change](https://ktul.com/news/local/3-osu-students-take-their-own-lives-students-want-change)  \n  \n>  \n>Fourth, OSU Safety's Twitter account (@OkstateSafety) tweeted out news that two OSU students had stolen a Trump 2020 from someone's lawn, assuring the community that an investigation was under-way (Oct 21st 9:47am). Immediately, these two students had names and addresses leaked by people commenting. Threats to these students were made, and verbal abuse hurled at them. Though several OSU students and faculty asked OSU Safety to take down this tweet or disable comments to protect these students, OSU Safety left this tweet up until the next day (afternoon of Oct. 22nd), enough time to allow the identity and personal information of these students to be widespread. In today's hostile political climate, this certainly endangered the well-being of these students. Given that OSU has not prioritized student well-being, this endangerment of students is a disgusting and disgraceful act by OSU as an institution.  \n  \n>  \n>Demands:  \n(1) OSU needs to tighten rules for returning to campus, ensuring that symptomatic students cannot return without medical screening by a doctor and negative COVID-19 test.  \n(2) OSU needs to tighten contact tracing, so that no symptomatic students slip through the cracks.  \n(3) OSU needs to alert faculty and classmates of COVID-positive students prior to that student returning to campus, if the student showed symptoms, and especially if the student was still symptomatic.  \n(4) OSU needs to make mental-health care available to all students. Perhaps the University ought to ensure all students access to free Better Help services (at the very least), or contract with counselors outside of the University.  \n(5) OSU Safety needs to publicly apologize for the students above for allowing their personal information to leak, and commit to this never happening again.  \n(6) OSU needs to implement a Pass/No-Pass grading option for Fall 2020, and likely for Spring 2021.",

        "body": "I would like to include my two cents here:\n\nI'm an HDFS: CFS major, looking to go into counseling and therapy services for a career. From several others who I have talked to and heard from, there's been mixed feelings on OSU Counseling Services. I can't speak on behalf of the other services provided, but I can comment on the services that are offered as part of our fees for attending the university. As of the 21st, those \"free\" counseling sessions that we are provided have a 6 month waiting list, one person of which had a 45 minute waiting time on the phone. \n\nWith three confirmed suicides already this semester, mental health is an all time high concern. Although teachers and students might be more \"prepared\" for this virtual-intensive college experience, by no means is it easy. We lose out on that genuine face-to-face experience with instructors and professors, which all of us partly use to learn, some more than others. This is a big contributor to the stresses we as students experience, on top of a general lack of social contact and interactions, with financial strain topping it all off. For those students who are genuinely struggling, they realistically have next to no feasible resources to use. \n\nBut this isn't just a fault of OSU Counseling Services' staff; it's a fault of funding. Last I heard, there were 20 or so faculty for counseling services to aid 24,000 students. This gives a ratio of about 1:1200 for faculty:student ratio. To put that in perspective, the American School Counselor Organization encourages high schools to maintain a maximum if 1:250 ratio; it would be safe to assume that colleges, although bigger in size, should at least be around the 1:400 ratio. Clearly, OSU does not meet this. \n\nIt's because of COVID that this huge understaffing and underfunding issue is finally coming to light. While we might not be able to fix that immediately, we can at least take action to do what we can in the short-term. We can be there for our friends, our family, and anybody else who we know is in a bad spot mentally. Until OSU steps up to the plate to make improvements on an ever-growing concern, it's gonna be up to us. Don't be afraid to speak up or reach out.",

I\u2019m not sure how we are this far into the pandemic for you to still hold this viewpoint.

Not an insane situation, right? Now the goal is to reduce spread\u2014we can only limit necessary interactions so much. And the amount of people I will interact with on my grocery run while sick is probably pretty low.\n\nNow let\u2019s assume that (again while sick and without concerning symptoms) I stop by my friend\u2019s house to have a movie night. Let\u2019s say the house has three occupants (roommates of the friend.) We share popcorn, relax, etc, and then I go on my merry way. They are now infected. We all continue with our necessary tasks (grocery shopping, attending work, etc) and come into various other people in the community. These people may NOT be low risk. They may be older, or be the primary caretakers of older family members, or they may even be off duty CNA\u2019s who work at a retirement home. Who knows. The point is that the more unnecessary interactions we have with others, the more likely the spread will reach someone who it impacts greatly.",

They mostly focus on talking about how what they're struggling with is affecting their grades. They aren't trying to actually help them is what I am told. This is coming from students who have seen counselors before and can compare the experiences. There are also long waits to see the counselors. Do you know how many there are at OSU? I know the national average ratio for a college is around 1700 students to 1 student which is way worse than the recommended of 1000-1500 to 1. I would like to know the ratio here. I'm not trying to drag on the counselors completely because I'm sure 99% of this can be tied back to admin, I'm just saying that not everything can be solved by saying \"well we have counselors so...\".

And it is important to state that if there is going to be a massive rise again in cases, at worse, OSU's plan is go online only for a week or two. And note that it isn't about case count, it is more about whether new cases are trackable to other cases. As long as they feel like they can test, contact trace, and quarantine, they don't plan on shutting down anything. \n\nRemember how we got here -- there was a very loud group of students and parents that fought last Spring and Summer for going back to face to face. They won mostly. But then, some deans and departments gave into faculty demands for flexibility right when the semester began. So students then got blindsided with instruction formats when it was too late to really do much to change it. \n\nWhat students should be doing now is pressing for more clarity and planning. The class list is published, but trust me when I say it is still in flux and tons of classes listed as face to face now may go online or a form of hybrid still, and vice versa. Departments need to figure out -now- what the spring is going to look like class by class so students can actually plan accordingly and avoid hybrid and online (or, plan on going totally online). One of the changes I have heard is that there will be less flexibility in the Spring with regards to testing and attendance policies, so don't plan on being able to skip face to face classes.\n\nWrite to your department heads and deans, y'all (but be respectful and to the point) and emphasize that you need to be sure things aren't going to change all willy nilly on you over winter break.\n\nThat being said, there is an increase in the number of students that appear to be complaining about falling being in classes that are face to face because the same students aren't attending in person and can't commit themselves to the proper number of hours for studying.  So, make sure this isn't a -you- problem before making complaints.",

You talk about the \"walk on program\" and the most prevalent state under Devaney and Osborne being Nebraska... because of the \"walk on program\". But when Nebraska left the Big XII it affected their ability to recruit Texas. I'm an Oklahoma State fan. There have been Oklahoma State fans clamoring, idiotically, to join the Pac-12. Guess what would happen to our Texas recruiting? It would go to zero and our program would die. Thinking that you can change the geography of where you play and the geography of where you recruit stays the same is delusional. One affects the other.",

It was hot after the first month of the season, but changes were made to the staff and starting QB and Boise State rebounded to finish with 10 wins, play in the conference championship game, and win their first bowl in like 5 years so now Avalos' seat has cooled off considerably.  A lot will depend on his new OC hire since Tim Plough isn\u2019t there to take the blame anymore and Dirk Koetter went back into retirement.  \n\nUsing the \"beat zero P5 teams in the last two seasons\" is kinda disingenuous when they've only had two such chances: a loss to Oklahoma State (who that season would win the Fiesta Bowl) where an early whistle took away what likely would have been a game-winning TD late, and a road loss to Oregon State who turned out to be a top 20 team. It would take a disastrously bad season for him to get fired.  The OOC slate is brutal this season and I wouldn't be shocked if they start with 3 losses off the bat (@ Washington, v. UCF, @ Memphis?), especially with a new OC and replacing I think 8 of 11 defensive starters.  But if Avalos can rebound to have another strong in-conference season, and the team shows improvement on offense and defense, I think his seat will be fine.\n\nAnd there\u2019s probably no way Harsin is coming back to Boise.  He was already very polarizing with the fanbase because many (including myself) felt like he was routinely getting outcoached and was getting by on having superior talent.  He also burnt a lot of bridges with Boise State administration in his last year or two.  It\u2019s unlikely he even gets consideration if Boise\u2019s HC job is open",

        "body": "Correct.\n\nHm, now you've got me wondering who's been in how many polls. It's a short era so I could look it up relatively quickly.\n\nEdit: And done. Some things to note: Likely because it was brand new and they wanted to show it off, 2014 had 7 CFP polls instead of the usual 6, so teams that were good that year have a slight edge over teams who were good in other years; meanwhile, 2020 only had 5, so a perfect score is still 49. Also, being good in the end *does* give you an advantage over having a fast start, because only twice in the eight completed years has the final poll had any differences from the preceding week other than shuffling: 2014, when the Big 12 didn't have a CCG yet and played regular season games on CCG week and Oklahoma was knocked out with a Bedlam loss, and 2020, when unranked Oregon won the Pac-12 Championship Game and moved up to #25.\n\n49 for 49: Alabama and Ohio State. That's the whole list.  \nOver 75%: Clemson (46), Oklahoma (46), Notre Dame (38), Georgia (37). Already we're seeing some of that bias towards teams who were good in 2014; Georgia was completely absent for two years and ranked throughout in the other 6 and is in the first poll this year, same as the first name in the next category, but one of that team's two years of being out was 2014 and the other *wasn't* 2020 so they fall just short of 75%.  \nOver 50%: Oklahoma State (36), Utah (36), LSU (34), Michigan (32), Wisconsin (32), Auburn (29), Florida (28), Oregon (27), USC (27), Baylor (26), Iowa (26), Michigan State (26), Penn State (25). I often forget how consistent Utah's been since joining the Pac-12; I would've expected Oregon to be the first Pac-12 team on the list.  \nOver 25%: Mississippi State (24), Boise State (20), Northwestern (20), TCU (20), Texas A&M (20), Florida State (19), Ole Miss (19), Cincinnati (18), Washington (18), NC State (17), Washington State (17), Iowa State (15), Memphis (15), Stanford (15), West Virginia (14), North Carolina (13), UCF (13). I wasn't sure how to do the next category; I initially wanted to cut off those who only appeared in 3 different years, but that would mean cutting it very short since FSU hasn't actually made a poll since 2016 after being 19 for 19 through the first three years. Ultimately I decided to just go with another 25%. Also, yes, this week's #25 ranking is the only time UCF has been in a poll outside of their two undefeated seasons. And yes, Boise State is still the leader in G5 teams, even though the AAC as a whole has done better than the MWC.  \nClearly not just one-year wonders: Navy (12), Texas (12), BYU (11), Houston (11), Louisville (11), Miami-FL (11), Minnesota (11), UCLA (11), Kansas State (10), Virginia Tech (10), Kentucky (9), Pittsburgh (9), Arizona (8), Colorado (8), Nebraska (8), Wake Forest (8). There are teams below this who have been ranked in multiple years, too, but this is the cutoff that no team could get in without being ranked in multiple years, and since tied teams are listed in alphabetical order, the next category will indeed *start* with a team that was ranked for all of 2014 and hasn't been ranked since. That group of teams at 8 is pretty interesting, though; Nebraska fans will insist that their presence must be a mistake because they've been dogshit since well before the start of the playoff era (and admittedly, every season in the playoff era that they *weren't* ranked at some point has seen them finish under .500), and Arizona seems like they've been down for a long time but they did crack the Top 25 for one week in 2017 and were a strong team in 2014, which like I said gives you a slight advantage over other one-year teams.  \nOne good year, or the equivalent thereof: Arizona State (7), Missouri (7), Syracuse (7), Tennessee (7), Arkansas (6), Fresno State (6), Georgia Tech (6), Louisiana (6), San Diego State (6), Temple (6), Western Michigan (6), Appalachian State (5), Coastal Carolina (5), Indiana (5), Tulsa (5). 3 out of the 4 teams with 5 appearances are indeed season-long members from 2020, so that's where the cutoff is. Tennessee will of course be blasting out of this category this year.  \nAlso present at least once: Boston College (3), Duke (3), Marshall (3), UTSA (3), Virginia (3), San Jose State (2), SMU (2), Toledo (2), Utah State (2), East Carolina (1), Illinois (1), Oregon State (1), Purdue (1), South Carolina (1), Tulane (1). Unsurprisingly, half of the teams with a single appearance are the trio that just made their debut in the most recent poll. On the opposite end of the spectrum, East Carolina was the very first G5 team to make a CFP poll, coming 23rd in the first poll of 2014 (somewhat curiously, since neither the Pirates' ranked-at-the-time loss nor their ranked-at-the-time win were actually ranked), and they haven't been back since after losing their next two games and not even putting up another winning season until just last year.",

        "body": "About this time in August last year, I\u2019d have been all over the idea of joining the Pac-12, but watching Big XII basketball this past year and seeing the success of new additions like Cincinnati and Houston, I\u2019m more than content to stay in the Big XII now. That\u2019s no diss to the Pac-12, I think culturally speaking Tech is very similar to UofA and ASU, but the rest of the conference does nothing for me and half of it does not care about competing at a high level.\n\nSay what you want about Big XII schools, but all of us have invested heavily and tried to put out the best product we can. Historically challenged programs like Oklahoma State, Iowa State and Baylor have all spent tons of money on ensuring that they keep elite-level coaches happy and continue their unprecedented levels of success in football. I\u2019ve seen Tech and TCU both swing for the fences in coaching searches this past year, as well as new additions Houston and Cincinnati spend high-level money to lock down Holgorsen and Fickell. \n\nI just don\u2019t see that level of competitiveness in the Pac-12, I think there\u2019s some very good schools at respective sports (Utah/USC/Oregon football, Arizona/UCLA/Oregon basketball), but as a whole the conference has unique struggles that I would rather not be apart of.",

For academics, state school affiliation (California), and/or religious drama.\n\nHawaii: doesn\u2019t bring much to the table aside from being in Hawaii.\n\nCSU: doesn\u2019t bring anything new that Colorado already brings to the table. \n\nNevada and UNLV: They need better success and academics. Las Vegas and a new stadium are tempting to look into, but not tempting enough to invite.\n\nBaylor: Religion and event history would be a problem.\n\nTCU: Religious affiliation is the main thing keeping them out. FYI, I really like TCU. \n\nKansas schools: They make a better fit in the Big 10 culture than any group with the PAC 12.\n\nOklahoma state: I really like them, but distance and lack of a reasonable travel partner, and time zones are a problem.\n\nTexas Tech: The highest candidate for a Texas school joining the PAC 12, aside from Texas. But it\u2019s more of a have to than a want to invite. Since they would bring recruiting into the picture. Marketing, is debatable. Since Texas and Texas A&M dominate Texas.\n\nHouston: commuter school label is hard to remove.\n\nLiberty: No one wants them, unless the conference is almost dead.\n\nMy personal wants that aren\u2019t Texas or Oklahoma: Oklahoma State and TCU. \n\nRealistically it would have to be: Oklahoma State and Texas Tech. \n\nOnes I wouldn\u2019t mind: Houston, CSU, Oklahoma State, TCU and Texas Tech.\n\nDon\u2019t want: Baylor, BYU, and New Mexico State.",
