The intro class for each engineering major makes a difference too, as some will involve labwork but others won't. It's good to mix difficult classes with lighter ones each semester to avoid burning out.\n\nIf you're good at managing your time, college offers a lot of flexibility with scheduling classes. I knew I'm not a morning person, so I managed to almost never have a class before 9am in my computer science undergrad. If you have a specific time of day you like to go to the gym, your favorite general time to block out for studying, and a good idea of when you get hungry, fill your classes out around those times.\n\nI also had a good time when I let my Monday/Wednesday/Friday schedule be a lot different from Tuesday/Thursday. In at least two semesters, I packed classes in to MWF and left TR mostly open for either studying on busy weeks or free time on light weeks. You could do something similar while still blocking out a daily gym visit. Perhaps even a heavy TR with gym visits on MWF and the weekends.",

The bathroom floors aren\u2019t sloped correctly so the shower floor drains don\u2019t function properly.

Wefald also doesn\u2019t have the sense of community other buildings have. It\u2019s aesthetically nice but has a lot of problems underneath.

        "body": "As a disclaimer, my dorm knowledge dates back to 2016, although my brother currently lives in Moore. \n\nThat being said, single rooms are a rare commodity. I lived in Wefald the years it opened, and there were only like 3 single rooms per floor at the time so around 20 total. To answer your question, Wefald does tend to fill up faster and these rooms will likely be the most in demand. Due to the supply and demand gap if you\u2019re not extremely quick to get the room once the period opens up you\u2019ll miss out.\n\nHere\u2019s a bit of information, as I\u2019m a bit biased, but I disliked Wefald the most out of all the other dorms I lived in. It seemed more stuck up, more closed off than the others, and harder to build a sense of community around. I would only recommend Wefald if you\u2019re an underclassman majoring in engineering as that\u2019s the primary demographic of the hall. As a business major and an upperclassman it was difficult to connect with that demographic.\n\nI loved my years in Moore though. I feel like the Derby complex was more my kind of people. More relaxed, kind, down to earth people, and the sauce Moore was the largest hall with the most people I figured my odds were better at making friends there.\n\nI\u2019ve stayed in Moore, Wefald, Goodnow, Boyd (ex girlfriend), Ford (ex girlfriend), and West. Here are my observations from my time there:\n\nMoore: Largest hall, most people, diverse with quite a few international students, more chill and relaxed.\n\nHaymaker: Similar to Moore but at the time seemed a bit rowdier with more athletes, but since 2016 most athletes are in Wefald or off campus.\n\nWest: Kind of the bastard child of the Derby complex, but has since been remodeled. Smaller yet still pretty chill.\n\nFord: Full of sorority girls that don\u2019t talk or interact with anybody outside of their own sorority. Hard to build a community and connect. Would avoid if not in a sorority.\n\nBoyd, Van Zile, Putnam: Grouping these together as they\u2019re fairly similar. Smaller buildings that seemed more friendly and easier to build a community within. Hosted a lot of events, seemed generally happy.\n\nWefald: Athletes, rich kids, engineers, tended to be younger than all the other halls, huge building with 3 wings (men, women, co-ed) so seemed more closed off than a traditional dorm. People interacted but less than you\u2019d expect. A lot of freshmen engineers if you\u2019re looking to network. Building is really nice with good study rooms and close to engineering building.\n\nMarlatt: Seemed fairly chill, some more upper class men engineering majors. Tended to be more chill and down to earth.\n\nGoodnow: Friendly, easy to build a community, the building is the most outdated but I think it\u2019s been somewhat renovated. Probably the most \u201cparty\u201d dorm in the Kramer complex.\n\nHope that helps!",

Honestly they seemed kind of stupid. The people involved in them were kind of weird and socially awkward. That includes the people heading them which are referred to as RLA\u2019s. Some people I know were in these communities and thought it was one of the dumbest things ever. It\u2019s a significant amount of free time taken out of your day. A lot of the RLA\u2019s or cat community leaders gave off the vibe as somebody who wasn\u2019t qualified enough to be a RA, but seemed like enough of a kiss ass to warrant some sort of student employment position. There were 4 in my building in 2015 and this is how it turned out:\n\nRLA 1: Kicked out and fired for smoking weed in about 3 months\n\nRLA 2: Gave off weird vibes. Was friendly, but I wouldn\u2019t want to be alone with him. And I\u2019m a guy.\n\nRLA 3: Got fired for sexually harassing one of his community members\n\nRLA 4: was actually cool, but got fired in spring semester for an alcohol related incident\n\nI think after Covid they might have opened up more single rooms so you might be in luck. My brother applied to Moore late and didn\u2019t have any trouble getting a single room. The single room he got was the size of a traditional double room, so I think they just converted some due to dorm residents decreasing.\n\nHope this helps, I think Goodnow is a good fit for you.",

You have to have moved to Kansas for reasons other than school and have established residency with a Kansas address (on a DL) for 12 months without being enrolled at all. If she gets a job and pays taxes in the state of Kansas proving this residency is significantly easier. There's no way to get around that 12 months of official residency without going to school. Unfortunately you can't just go to school and pay out-of-state for a year while you have the KS address then pay in-state the next year (can't flip for the remainder).

You can ask for a delay once accepted to meet that requirement.\nCall it the most pedestrian gap-year ever! I did exactly that when I came to KS for school myself (but that was in 1996.) The biggest problem I had was finding a job in a college town for that year, honestly!\n\nAlso, do be aware that my understanding was that if you move to KS to go to K-State and start out as a out-of-state student, they will not reclassify you in a year unless you have some sort of other reason for being in KS. So if your whole family moves here, they'd probably be willing to change your classification. If it's just a student alone, though, they'll probably want to charge them nonresident tuition for all 4 years. It's a \"reason/intent to stay after graduation\" that they're looking for.\n\nGood luck!",

I recommend Auntie Maes as a pretty chill bar, rockabelly deli is also solid. Campus is very walkable, it\u2019s tightly packed and doesn\u2019t require students hopping on a shuttle/bus to get to another class on time. You can easily get from one end to the other walking in 15-20 minutes so I\u2019d just mosey around a bit before the game maybe. Anderson Lawn is probably the most recognizable area on campus, our library is pretty cool and has an old study area that\u2019s been kept to look like it\u2019s original early 20th century design that students call the \u201cHarry Potter Room\u201d.\n\nPregame our tailgate scene is a massive parking lot surrounding the stadium that\u2019s maybe a 3/4 of a mile off campus, people are pretty friendly if you want to wander around tailgates. It\u2019ll also be Harley Day which is an annual tradition where probably 50ish fans donate money to ride motorcycles around the field 10-15 minutes before kickoff",

There is however one professor in the program who is super conservative and actively makes fun and mocks people who are liberal (they have gotten in trouble multiple times so they might not do it as much as when I had in 7 years ago) who atleast 7 years ago used to teach a couple classes.

There's same-sex couples holding hands in public, people put pride flags on their houses and apartment windows. Again, this is my straight, cis perspective, but I don't think people would be doing those things if they didn't feel safe.\n\n\n>KSU tends to be a more republican school than in Lawerence\n\n\nOne thing to keep in mind here is that Lawrence is very liberal not just by Kansas standards, but by national standards. That doesn't mean that KSU is \"more Republican\". Only in comparison to one of the most liberal campuses in the country. It's still an average college town and those ALWAYS skew left, even in extremely rural places. You could probably go to a college town in a place even more rural than Kansas like Wyoming or Alaska and you'd still be in the same town, basically. To some extent, all college towns are the same.\n\nAlso, notice that according to the surveys I linked at the beginning of this comment, we're actually ranked higher than KU at least in regards to campus resources for LGBT folks.\n\nI would suggest reaching out to K-State's LGBT center  for more information.\n\nhttps://www.k-state.edu/lgbt/",

And you can maybe sell them back to the bookstore for 10 or 15 bucks.\n\nFor the 5% of classes that actually use the textbook, don't stress about not knowing ahead of time which classes those are. The professors know that nobody buys the texts, they will make it clear in the first day if you are going to need it. You can get it off the internet at that point (get older editions, hardly anything changes in these books between editions).\n\nIf you absolutely get caught off guard and need a text right away (say, a week into classes), the bookstore is always there. Yeah, it's expensive, but use it as an emergency option. Using it once or twice over your college days is still a lot cheaper than buying every book ahead of time.\n\nYou will regret buying books ahead of time. Listen to everybody here, just don't do it. You will save hundreds of dollars your first semester alone, and after that you should be able to see for yourself how unnecessary they are.",

It may look like a pile of semen atop breaded chicken, but I assure you it tastes heavenly.\n\n&nbsp;\nLittle Apple Brewing Co. was a go to when family was in town. Great beer great food, great atmosphere. \n\n\n&nbsp;\nHoulihans is interesting. It's a chain, not a local joint but we always had super good service and phenomenal food. \n\n&nbsp; \nThere was a Jamaican place in the middle of nowhere (it seemed) north of town.

I live in an apartment building roughly 3/4 of a mile walk from the Student Union and the building most of your PoliSci courses would be in. We pay $800 total ($400 a person) a month for a fairly spacious 2-bed/1-bath apartment. It's all electric and the building pays water, so our only bills are electricity and internet. I think our rent is pretty standard, but there's some luxury apartments even closer to campus that rent by the room for more money and of course there's always older houses for rent surrounding campus on three sides.\n\nKansas--like the rest of the region-- has fairly low food, energy and gas prices compared to other parts of the country as well.\n\nManhattan is definitely a small college town in the middle of nowhere but has basically everything you could want, imo. It's a town of about 50k that revolves around the university and Fort Riley down the road a little ways. There's good bars and restaurants, two breweries, hiking, nightlife all wrapped up in a tight-knit community. I'd say the town and school are fairly conservative, but compared to the rest of the state it is pretty liberal. I've been here six years (undergrad and grad school) and I love it.",

We paid just over $600/month for a brand new apartment that we loved which was just over a half mile away from campus. I walked to and from campus daily all year round. In the winter, it wasn't bad. In the summer when I teaching classes, I needed a shower by the time I got to campus. \n\nGrad life on campus really varies department-by-department. My department had a very active grad program that had a lot of social events which made it really easy to meet new folks. I was on the graduate student council and this was not the case with some of my peers from other programs. \n\nI work in the broad field of public policy and would encourage you to think about what you hope to get from this program. One of the super important things that you can get from a graduate department (aside from the education) are the connections that you make with other grad students and professionals. KState is a regional school that doesn't have a ton of pull outside of Kansas so you might find that your connections don't travel well.

        "body": "I'm living in Jardine currently, though I won't be next semester for reasons unrelated to Jardine. I don't know about the dimensions of a renovated one bedroom because I've only lived in a four bedroom.\n\nOverall, I think it's a nice place to live. The surroundings are nice, you get free wifi, and depending on what apartment you live in, you may also get free water and/or free electricity. There's also plenty of space, the doors are lockable, the kitchen is decent (though it only has one drawer), and it's leagues better than the dorms in terms of price and privacy imo.\n\nMost of the complaints I've heard about Jardine are that it's more expensive that similar apartments off campus, which seems to be more or less true, though not in my opinion by an exorbitant amount.\n\nA few things to know if you do decide to live here(mobile formatting, hopefully it doesn't look too bad):\n-pets aren't really allowed, though it seems like you can get around that if the animal is for emotional support?\n\n-some apartments have a washer and dryer in them. Some don't\n\n-because the wifi is K-State wifi, you're not allowed to host a server off of it (may or may not affect you)\n\n-if you do live in a multi-bedroom apartment, you should know that Jardine doesn't assign roommates at all, so you'll need to get that figured out yourself beforehand.\n\n-the contract is from July 1 through the end of June, so basically the whole year. This means you can stay over the summer fine without moving out at all if you stay in the same apartment the next year. This is pretty useful if you plan to work in Manhattan while school is on break.\n\nEdit: formatting",

The modern or myself and my roommate is $610 a month is $3660 for a semester. That is for 2Be 1Ba. It is I think $50-75 less expensive per month for additional rooms (3 Bed I think is 530 a month? Or 3180 per semester I think).  Remember this includes all internet, trash, etc. But you pay electric separate. There are families that live in the modern ones, but i've seen more international students and families in the traditional buildings.\n\nPersonally, I like Jardine because it's not like you're paying a ton for COX internet and Jardine has easy access to the bus route (which stops on both sides of Jardine!). Jardine is also good because you have the cornerstone and JPs in the complex. It is usually more stable on campus than it is off campus I have found.",

JPs is a restaurant with burgers, salads, and other foods. For the washer and dryer I think it is $1.75 or $2 per load to wash and $1.75 or $2 to dry. HDS allows you to use Cat Cash (put money on your ID card) to use for that. At least in the dorms they did. I am not sure as I don't use it. I didn't have a good experience off-campus but that was likely because the roommate I had was not great at the time and there were parties at a different building and police were there frequently. The roommate is had was also not a student so that was a dividing line. I've found campus living to be more reliable in terms of it's mostly quiet and there aren't many, if any, police occurrences (not where I live anyway). Also, the people that live here are either students (Undergrad, Masters or PhD) or people who do research, usually for the college of agriculture.",

I don't care if they had only 8 scholarship players, they need to play to win and they didn't do so in those 2nd halfs in the past 4-5 games. If they want a chance to go to NIT or March Madness, then they need to really step it up and win games without choking the leads. Much improvement needed and I think Bruce Weber needs to go after this season as well.

As a pretty large school, if a fraternity it\u2019s something you\u2019re interested in I\u2019m sure you could find one that fits what you\u2019re looking for. Currently, the only fraternity that has a pretty universal bad reputation is sig ep, but everyone has their own opinions. You can\u2019t really generalize everyone in a certain frat. \n\n3. There are a good amount of in state kids, however the university is trying to recruit more out of state and it has worked in recent years. Personally, I\u2019m from Missouri and have met several people from out of state. Hell, one of my good friends is from San Diego. Right now, it feels like a majority of in state kids but with a fair dose of out of state.\n\n4. Kids really only go home on weekends if it\u2019s at least a 3 day weekend and they live within a couple of hours.

Seems like if the instructor has a low opinion of you from having that said that stuff, it's going to be hard to get her to repair the relationship or get any of those points back this late in the game.

        "body": "I have a few random pieces of advice, so I\u2019m listing them in no particular order: \n\nA: if you haven\u2019t already, go to counseling services and get into individual sessions. As a KState student, you\u2019re entitled to 8 FREE sessions per semester. Use them. These will help your mental health and can be pulled for documentation in the unfortunate case that this has to escalate. \n\nB. If you haven\u2019t already, go to Student Life. They have the capability of asking for academic accommodations from instructors that the instructors then must either follow or fight directly. They may be able to directly help you academically and can again be called upon later for documentation. \n\nC: If the 100/150 is because of bad applications of academic concepts or things you did that didn\u2019t match the rubric or instructions, that grade can\u2019t be challenged and is fair. However, if the points were deducted simply for your views (and the instructor\u2019s feedback on the document makes it clear that is the case), you can challenge the grade based on political discrimination. I wouldn\u2019t do this right now, but keep the assignment, rubric, instructions, and feedback for if you need it later. \n\nD: If those 50 points are all you\u2019re missing, I have good news. In a 500 point class, a 450 is an A, not a B. If you\u2019re missing only those 50 points, you still have another 51 points you could lose before you\u2019d drop to a C. \n\nE: assuming that what the instructor said is unfounded, keep ALL documentation that you have, including emails exchanged. If you have future meetings with this person, record them secretly. Kansas is a one-party consent state, which means you can legally record any conversation you\u2019re a part of. I would just record a video on your phone from your pocket or bag. The video doesn\u2019t matter, only the audio, so just darkness on the screen is fine as long as you can hear what\u2019s being said. Additionally, if the feedback on your assignments indicates discrimination or unfair point docking, KEEP IT. I mean download and save it or take screenshots. If shit goes down, the instructor can go in and erase or change feedback to make you look like a liar. You want separate documentation of what the original said. \n\nF: I would ride out most of the rest of the semester. Keep your head down as much as possible and try to generally give the instructor what she wants. If it becomes impossible for you to pass the class (meaning you miss more than 100 points total) AND you have evidence that those missed points were unfair (e.g., you\u2019re docked points directly for a view you hold rather than not following directions or applying content correctly, you\u2019re not given academic accommodations specified by a campus office, you\u2019re docked points for refusing to share personal information, you have evidence that the instructor graded you more harshly than other students based on a personal issue), then you should do the following steps in order: \n\n1. Email this instructor explaining the issue you think has occurred in a way that is both respectful and professional. For example: \u201cHello Dr. X, I\u2019m in Y class and am emailing about Z assignment. I\u2019m just confused about what I\u2019m missing some of these points for. I thought I followed the instructions and rubric and applied the concepts correctly. Would you mind explaining the following deductions and feedback a little more? I\u2019m also happy to meet if you\u2019d rather do so in person.\u201d Then KEEP whatever response you get or RECORD that meeting. \n2: If the above doesn\u2019t change your score AND you still have evidence the grade is unfair, escalate to the department head or chair. You might also meet with your academic advisor at this stage. Explain in a professional and respectful manner why you think the grade is unfair. Be specific. Explain that you have direct documentation of these issues. Ask for a meeting with the head. RECORD that meeting and KEEP that email exchange. If your evidence is solid, this should solve the issue. \n3. If it doesn\u2019t, and if you still believe your evidence is solid that unfair grading occurred, escalate to the Dean of the college. Do the same process that you did with the department head. \n4. If that doesn\u2019t work, escalate to the Dean of Students. Do the same thing. \n5. If that doesn\u2019t work, talk to the college\u2019s omsbudperson or your family lawyer. If you have exhausted these resources and have clear evidence of unfair treatment based on your politics or refusal to share personal information the school isn\u2019t entitled to, then you have what you need for a successful lawsuit. The issue will almost certainly not get this far. \n\nAll of that is a lot to take in right now, and you probably won\u2019t need most of it, but it\u2019s there just in case. Over the next few weeks, change what you can about how you engage with the instructor and the material. If that means lying and saying what she wants to hear rather than what you really think, then that\u2019s shitty of her, but it might be worth it to just go along. Spend the next 5-6 weeks doing the best you can. Be extra professional and polite in all interactions with her. Keep everything you have as documentation related to this issue, but only use it if you can\u2019t pass the class without doing so AND your evidence of unfair treatment is rock solid. \n\nI hope some of that is helpful!",

        "body": "So this is one of the biggest caveats of K-State IMHO. Your daughter is either parking in the D1 lot or by the R/Z lot next to derby, both of which are much so less than optimal at night for walking. Parking doesn't like to really help in these kinds of situations so especially with her assumedly having the R freshman parking pass I only have a few suggestions as a male junior:\n\n1. If she works during the weekend or is off campus past 5pm on Friday, the campus cops are usually done and dusted for the weekend. Parking right up at the dorm is your best bet for safety at night and will remove the risk of the long walks across the lots. The expected safe time to park without tickets would be Friday 5 pm to Monday 5 am, and I would not try to leave a car later than 5 am on a Monday. Sometimes they make rounds but in the three years I've been here I've never seen or been ticketed myself during these times. Just DON'T park in the staff parking!!! \n\n2. If she is at all close with her RA, she can definitely reach out to see if they would walk with her or if they can call another RA to help. This is a less likely option especially if it's late at night but she might be able to squeeze out a safe walking buddy. \n\n3. We have an app called Guardian that you can connect to K-State's campus which has a built in safe walk call feature. I've never personally used it but I've heard good things. You essentially call and explain where you are and they will send someone to make sure your walk is safe.\n\n4. The least likely option would be calling the parking services now/next semester and see if her time/grades here allows her to get a leveled up pass. This will most likely not happen but is always worth a shot.\n\nI always wanna try to help as much as possible with situations like these! I can't think of many more options now but those are what I've learned from experience. I believe the 5pm parking *might* work for after 5 pm on weekdays but I wouldn't trust that. My anecdotes only come from weekends. Other than calling a friend I don't believe there's a whole lot else to do about this issue though unfortunately.",

Essentially all that needs to be known is that if she lives on campus next year she'll be able to park on the lot in front of the dorm. It's pretty much free for all out here and that tends to be the first thing I say to incoming freshmen asking about parking.

We are [ABET accredited](https://www.cs.ksu.edu/academics/undergraduate/accreditation/) and offer several options to choose from, but we aren't so big that it's hard to stand out and get involved. Many of the professors I work with now were my teachers when I was an undergraduate, and they are a major reason that I chose to become an educator myself (I think they are great!). Being located in the Midwest US, we have affordable tuition and cost of living compared to many other schools, but still have graduates working at major companies such as Garmin, Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Cerner, and more. I encourage you to check out [our undergraduate programs](https://www.cs.ksu.edu/academics/undergraduate/) and [the integrated computer science program](https://www.k-state.edu/ics/) (full disclosure - I work directly with that program) or contact the CS department for more information.

Those opportunities are still paying off today as far as my marketability. Not necessarily the degree any more\u2026after 3-5 years working, your work experience will be more important than your schooling\u2026but the Masters gave me a big jumpstart \n\nThat being said, grad school tuition was waaaay cheaper a couple decades ago, so YMMV on whether it\u2019s financially worth it these days \n\nOh, and get any internships you can in HR if you can swing it.

Don\u2019t really know why people bother sneaking though. \n\nIf you\u2019re really sheltered, partying will not make you more well rounded. \n\nPick your priorities. 99% of success in college is prioritizing the important things. Anyone who flunks out chose to put social life ahead of class. Personally, i don\u2019t think it\u2019s hard to do both. Work then play. \n\nIn regards to your faith, there are a lot of religious groups on campus that revolve around the realistic aspect of modern life whole remaining true to your faith. I\u2019d look into it. \nBut I also want to warn you that the easiest way to get people to dislike you is to judge others based on your faith/values. Obviously we all have morals and ethics, but those are the things that would exist outside of your faith. It\u2019s all heavy I\u2019m sorry but I also know a few people who went to college with strong faith and judgements, and that just came with alienating people and eventually transferring or dropping out. But I promise that there are people exactly like you who want to study any dedication but also be a normal person who is realistic about the things around them! \n\nUseful items: \n- Reusable bags, I like the freezer bags from Sam\u2019s club\n- microwave and fridge (me and my roommate each provided one) \n- fan. Tower fans are my best friend\n- if you are sensitive to noise , ear plugs\n- wireless headphones. It\u2019s just easier. \n- lanyard. Most people have one but again, makes life easier. \n- some type of lamp, lights that you can adjust on your side of the room. It\u2019s nice when one of you is trying to sleep but you still need light. \n- give your parents a list of snacks you like. Especially ones that can be sent through amazon prime. People will ask what you like and if it\u2019s on amazon prime, you will get it sent to you. \n- STORAGE. Make everything compact. I have a travel sized hair dryer. I don\u2019t need a big one. I keep my makeup in a caboodle. I love those little three tiered carts. All great. \n- get an nespresso machine instead of Keurig. Way better, way nicer. Same priced machine. \n- command strips were invented by Jesus in college. I bought so many and have 0 qualms. Literally hung curtain rods and curtains with them. \n\nLast but unrelated: when you go home, look around your room. Bring back anything you don\u2019t use. Sometimes it\u2019s clothes, sometimes it\u2019s other stuff. It takes 5 minutes and you\u2019ll always grab something. \n\nAlso take a second to look at all of the things you can do in the library. There\u2019s a lot that goes unused like computers with Adobe stuff, etc. \n\nThat\u2019s a lot, but just things I wish I knew when I started. You\u2019ll love it. Good luck!",

        "body": "Welcome to K-State! The band program is great. Non-majors are allowed to participate in any of the three concert bands, as a non-major I played in Wind Ensemble for two years. Auditions are typically in-person the first week of classes, with excerpts posted on August 1st here: https://www.k-state.edu/band/index.html. Non-majors can typically take individual lessons with their faculty instructor, I've had a good experience with those too. \n\nThe fall is dominated by The Pride of Wildcat Land in the band program, its the highlight of my year! If you want to march, shoot me a message and I can get you connected with the correct people for your instrument. Music majors aren't even the most common major in the marching band, so don't let your major keep you from doing it!\n\nOn a non-band related note, the first week of classes there is an Activities Carnival in the Union. It's a great place to see what clubs are active on campus. Campus Labs is the website used to manage clubs, you can find listings there too.",

Fun fact: our student government controls 100% of where your campus privilege fee goes. When you add that up for every student paying, the total budget is about $16 million that is controlled entirely by students. It is so much fun and not at all like high school student council or anything. Feel free to pm me if you want more info!",

You can also consider taking an uber to the grocery store, using the ATA bus, or getting a bicycle (claflin is a tough road to bike, though).\n\nSome grocery stores also offer free delivery if you buy a certain amount. HyVee does it, not sure about dillons. If you find a roommate with a car, you might be able to plan your shopping trips together.\n\nWal-Mart is probably the cheapest groceries, but it's not that big of a difference.\n\nGramarcy apartments are pre-furnished and across the street from the football stadium, which are selling points for a lot of people. The place never gets cleaned up, trash everywhere, pool is gross, and the furniture they provide is junk. They've had problems with roaches too.\n\nI never had any issues with my place at the district. The A.C. broke a few times but they didn't drag their feet on fixing it. 90% or more of the residents are college kids, so there is often party noise on the weekends, but it never bothered me.Again, different ownership now, things might be different. \n\n\nDorms are a solid choice too. Didn't live in them myself, but had lots of friends who did. Best way to meet new people and make some friends, but you'll have to share a room with someone and there's a communal bathroom for an entire floor wing.",

West was under construction when I was on-campus, so I think it looks quite a bit different now and The Derb also is newly renovated! You\u2019ll want to get involved in your dorm and community; I met so many good friends in the dorms. \u201cFloor dinners\u201d were of the best times. I really recommend doing the cheesy back to school activities and taking advantage of free Call Hall at any events and booths. I also can\u2019t recommend enough - if you\u2019re wanting to work part time to find an on-campus job. They can be a great ways to get involved, meet people, and work with your schedule while also making a bit of money! \n\nWhile you\u2019re under 21, the true party scene will likely be house parties. Dirty Dawgs, Kaws House Party, and Tubby\u2019s were some of the 18+ bars while I was there and it can be a lot of fun just to go out with friends and dance. I\u2019ll be vague - be safe and smart, the bouncers are pretty good at doing their jobs in MHK. The Ville is a ton of fun to bar hop when you do turn 21, but I recommend pregaming to save money. \n\nYou HAVE to go the Varsity Truck after a night out. My other favorite spots are Top of the World, Manhattan hill, KS hill, So Long Saloon, The Chef, cookie bakes @ Mr. Ks, Arrow Coffee, Bluestem Bistro, and Public Hall. \n\nManhattan is a special place.

I know, no one has mentioned this but its important.\n\n2 - Sit in the front, toward the middle. It makes you have eye contact with the professor which in turn keeps your mind engaged and helps keep you awake.\n\n3 - Talk to your professors BEFORE there is a problem. If you feel like you dont understand something, let the prof know right away. Keep doing this until you understand. If you wait until you fail a test to go to the prof, its too late. If you go early, there is a VERY good chance you can retake a test because you identified the issue and he/she was unable to overcome your not understanding. That makes it a teaching problem.\n\n4 - Go To Class. Seriously. You are PAYING to be there. Show the F up.\n\n5 - Sit in the front, toward the middle. The prof will recognize you as someone who shows up, is awake and is engaged. If you approach them about an issue learning, you dont want them to say \"which class are you in?\"\n\n6 - Talk to your professors. I had to miss a ton of class because of ROTC commitments. I let my professors know early and rescheduling stuff, getting different deadlines, etc was not a problem. My son is also in ROTC and because I beat this into him he did the same. Toward the end of last semester he was going to miss a quiz in a class he had an A in. The professor said \"You have an A. Im going to assume you will ace this quiz\" and gave him credit for taking the quiz.\n\n7 - Go to class, sit up front, talk to your professors.\n\n8 - TWO HOURS. Dedicate two hours a night to homework/study. Two honest hours. That means no phone, no TV, no reddit for two hours of solid study. Do this 5 nights a week - Sunday to Thursday. No Studying Friday night. Your brain needs a rest. Saturday is optional or additional study. You might need to study more some days/nights but never go less. ALWAYS do your two hours. ALWAYS.\n\n9 - Hear it, write it, use it in context. Hear what the professor says. Write down what you hear. Use that in context. Do this and you will LEARN. if you take notes in class, rewrite them after class and your retention will skyrocket. Use it in context and you will internalize.\n\n10 - Seriously, two hours. If you do that from the first day of the term to the end you will not have to cram at the end of the semester. Two good hours every day. Two good hours. Trust me. It works.\n\nAnd 11 - Go. To. Class.",

The West Stadium had just opened and my daughter was a UMASS student so it seems like destiny said to go.  I was honestly gobsmacked at how much Manhattan had changed.  It went from Applebees being fine dining to a foodie town with amazing options.  Dinner at Coco Bolos, breakfast at The Chef and doughnuts at Varsity.  The friendliness of campus had spread to the city and it was no longer a \"townies vs gownines\" atmosphere.   \n\nMy son just graduated in May and I was honestly sad to drive away.

        "body": "Hi! I am a fairly recent graudate of the business school (along with a major and some other concentrations outside of business)! To be truthful, I did very well in classes and was pretty accomplished (super high grades, involved in qutie a few things, had related work experiences), but never really felt like I \"fit\" in the cba and would be totally lying if I said I found most classes engaging. Because I never really enjoyed most of my classes, I can't say I was ever super happy with my choice, but don't let that color your view too much - alot of that was a fit issue and is really on me for not taking the time I needed to discover what I wanted to do before it was pretty much too late to change my major. On a semi-related note, I work outside of the standard business spheres now.\n\nIn general, you can get a business degree (especially in general or HR management or marketing) with very little difficulty. I was in marketing, and honestly, I'm pretty sure if you have a basic sense of logic you can graduate in that major, maybe even with decent grades. Only a few classes (usually finance and accounting, and sometimes economics) can be a bit more difficult, but you can usually manipulate your schedule each semester to help balance out your workload if needed. That said, I do think that business majors have more demanding extra-cirrucular schedules than outsiders probably realize; if you actually want a business career after graduation, you will have lots of competition from high-achieving graduates with excellent grades, work/internship experience, and who have spent lots of time to make sure they are well-presented to recruiters in their target companies or industries. Because typical \"business major\" career paths are really competitive, don't totally let the easy classes make you complacent if you are serious about landing a good role out of school.\n\nAs for the people, it's K-State, so everyone is pretty nice. Most of the professors are pretty reasonable and approachable. Just check Rate My Professor and maybe talk to a few friends to dodge the bullets you can in terms of unnessecarily hard professors. Most of the students in the business school are involved in greek life, so it can be hard to integrate and make friends with classmates if you aren't involved in that part of campus, but again, most are still reasonably nice. The business school also has resources in the career center, which can be  helpful, as long as you are proactive about pursuing those opportunities.\n\nSorry for the super long post-hopefully this helps some!",

I sent a DM to make a connection.\n\nFor folks watching from home, here's the short version - the Integrated CS program is targeted at students who want to learn programming as it applies to a particular field (like finance), but without all of the heavy math and CS theory that comes with a CS degree. It's good for getting into development roles, and it might even be enough to go for a higher level position like team lead. However, it does have a bit less CS theory, so you may not have the base skills to become a software architect or some of the more advanced engineering positions. It's a tradeoff.  \nWhat you do gain is the flexibility to focus on your own interests, like finance, and find a way to blend the two together in a unique way.  \nThe ICS program is very new - we just started it this spring, so there isn't much to say about students who have graduated it just yet. Here's hoping we have some good information in the next couple of years.\n\nMore info is here: [https://www.k-state.edu/ics/](https://www.k-state.edu/ics/)\n\nI'd love to hear from some Finance majors as well - I think it would be a good fit with ICS.",

For context I have been involved in software development for 18 years now as a program manager working with defense, telecommunication, and medical systems.\n\nA degree like this is something I as a non-technical program manager would really value on my teams. Someone who understands the coding process and the the application from an end user perspective is always very difficult to find. I typically have a lot of coders who understand code very well but do not understand the users need because they don't understand what the user is doing or I have users that know what they want but do not understand the difficulty of creating it from the coding point of view.\n\nIf you can do both you are bridging gap that exists in every industry (that I have seen) and every company (that I have worked with).\n\nIn the short term pursue the proficiency in CS and Finance. Keep an eye on the Program Management as a future career evolution. Someone that can talk deep technical details with development teams, speak with users about their needs, and run the business side of a development project will always be in demand. Give a look at the Program Management Professional certification as something to check on every few years to see if it fits where you are at that point in your career.\n\nHappy to talk further if you have any questions.",

The [CS program](https://www.cs.ksu.edu/) is [ABET Accredited](https://www.cs.ksu.edu/academics/undergraduate/accreditation/) and goes deep into the technical details and theory needed to be a programmer, software architect, and more. It also is a great starting point if you want to go into research and graduate school. Because of this, it requires more math and science, and goes deep into some very tricky topics such as logic, operating systems, hardware, algorithm analysis, and more. With this degree, you'll have a much higher ceiling in terms of the jobs that you can apply for and will have the skills to perform.\n\nThe [ICS program](https://www.k-state.edu/ics/) is much more flexible - you'll learn lots of programming, including how to build your own programs with GUIs, unit testing, and more. It includes pretty much the same core programming content as the CS program, but not as much of the other theory and technical topics. You'll also learn about web development, databases, system administration, and data science (all courses that are similar to the electives that CS majors take). It also requires a bit less math and science than the CS program. The ICS program also requires you to complete a concentration in any other area, such as math, statistics, physics, business, ag, or any other major/minor/certificate at K-State. They are pretty good at finding a way to make it work. Additionally, the ICS program is available online, though not all concentrations have online availability. In terms of jobs, you'll have the skills you need to work as a programmer or developer in general or in jobs related to your concentration, but may not have the deep technical skills to move up as high or as quickly as a CS major without some additional training. \n\nHope that helps!",

Ignore common \u201cstereotypes\u201d that you hear about each house and make your own decision. I genuinely think that most chapters are melting pots of a lot of people with varying degrees of partying, academics, religion, and political views.\r  \n2.\tFraternities at KSU do informal recruiting. Meaning there is no official \u2018rush week\u2019 as the sororities do at K-State. Recruiting chairs for each house will hold events and even 1 on 1 sessions to get to know people and if they like you they\u2019ll extend you a bid. Basically an invite to begin the process of joining their fraternity. There is no obligation to join after receiving a bid. \r  \n3.\tA lot of underclassmen live on campus and move off campus as they get older. Off campus is cheaper but understandably a little more difficult to get involved with university groups, clubs, etc. Not impossible but you aren\u2019t pushed into it like you are when you live on campus. At least when I was  at KSU living in a fraternity was cheaper than the dorms because a meal plan and boarding is all included in your membership dues (There are other fees that come along ie parties, philanthropy donations, t-shirts, potential fines. Etc.) but each chapter is unique it that aspect.

I prefer off camps for a number of reasons: cheaper, I make the rules, I have my own bathroom and bedroom, I have an actual kitchen, no curfew, etc. There are a few off-campus apartments like the UC that are student based housing - they also help with roommates if need - they  have great amenities and pool parties. I can't tell you how many drunken activities I've been to there. And it's right next to the stadium.** \r  \n\rIs anyone allowed to use the gyms, tennis courts, pool, etc? -**yes and no. You have to have a student ID to get into the rec, you can bring guests but I think there is a cost for them. But generally, anyone can use any of the city parks - Cico, City and (I think) Anneberg park all have tennis courts. And a lot of college kids go to City Park because it's right by Aggieville.** \r  \nWhat's the best way to make friends? -**I made a couple friends in the dorms, but most of my college friends I made through my job. Even if you don't need a job, maybe consider getting one for extra cash and meeting people. I worked at Longhorn Steakhouse - a lot of college kids work serving jobs.** \r  \nIs it easy to get a job on campus? -**for me it wasn't easy at all to find a job on campus, but I held jobs at Journeys, Texas Roadhouse and Dillards in addition to LH.** \r  \nHow are parties like? **- from my experience, usually if you are not in a frat they will not let you in a frat party as a dude - I'm a woman though so I haven't had that problem. Other parties are fun af - especially Fake Patties Day, after football games, etc. Aggieville is a popular party spot.** \r  \nAre most people from around Kansas? -**Yes and no. I'm from Manhattan, but I met people from alllll over the world. Mostly other kansans though lol** \r  \nAny tips I should know before attending? -**Don't be afraid to make friends - most likely everyone else would love a new friend. Don't be afraid to ask questions in class, most likely everyone is wondering the same thing. Get involved on campus if you can, this helps make friends and possibly build your resume.**",

I can tell you that all the B-wing rooms were renovated back in 2017-2018, and the rest of the building was renovated in the 2018-2019 school year. Some rooms have a grey plastic floor with a simulated wood grain texture, while others have a brown plastic wood floor. All rooms have digital thermostats, dry hydrogen peroxide machines, ethernet, and they renovated the ceiling to now have ceiling tiles and the lights are no longer in a box, but now in a... half tube of sorts? Kinda hard to explain. The only place they didn't get a lot of loving was the restrooms, and that's just because they didn't have the resources to completely tear them down. What they did do was they made all the showers have a divider, and have the shower head on that divider. They also sealed up the bathtub, which was used to clean off people's feet after playing in the volleyball pit. Couldn't explain to you why.",

I don't know how it works online or what they are doing this semester, and I haven't gone in a bit (bc I'm a senior and none of my classes are taught there), but SAS saved my ass. I went there like every day after lecture and just worked the entire homework with the tutor. They usually provide useful bits of knowledge. Other than that, talk to your professor and ask him if you just may not be getting everything. I'll assume you're a freshman or a sophomore based on taking calc 2, so idk how comfortable you are with your professors, but most are more than willing to help you with something, or to at least point you in the right direction",

A common trap people fall into is just memorizing the solution, but it's more important to understand the concept itself that question is trying to quiz you on, since the question will probably be a little different. I found the best way to do this, was to watch YouTube videos (Khan Academy's are good) around the concept (e.g. searching for videos on integration by parts, and practicing integration by parts until I was comfortable with any integration by parts question). If I still don't understand these concepts, go to a teacher or SAS tutor.\n\n* Old exams. If I remember correctly, the math department posts old exam archives of previous year's midterms and finals for study purposes. These can make a great addition to the study guide, using the same study method as above.",

There\u2019s no guarantee you\u2019ll like you\u2019re roommate but that\u2019s a nice thing about such a big state school. You\u2019ll be interacting with thousands of other students with hundreds of opportunities, you\u2019ll find a group that you like and belong to.

        "body": "1. Would def go with the dorms if you don't know who your roommate is going to be. There are more rules for you, but that means there's also more structure if you get into a pickle. K-State is understanding of roommate issues and will try to move you (when possible) if you get a really bad one. There's a few options: traditional 2 person, traditional 2 person but you buy out the other slot in the room (so you live alone but you still have community bathing), and suites where you only have to share a bathroom with your suite-mates. There's also Jardine apartments, which is an interesting hybrid where you get the dependability of K-State, but you get your own room and a kitchen. The dorms are usually more expensive though, so that's something to consider.\n\n2. The sooner the better. For off-campus apartments within walking distance stuff goes off the market quickly. I was able to find one late last summer, but only because of the uncertainty of COVID. Since you're an incoming freshman you'll have less priority for the dorms too (returning students get first pick), so I would figure out what type of dorm you're doing for and find a roommate ASAP. \n\n3. For the dorms they have this weird \"roommate dating site\" thing that kinda works like tinder. You make a profile about what your lifestyle is like, and then you can add some stuff about what kind of roommate you're looking for.\n\n4.  Depending on the major and how quickly you want to get out of college, minors are hard to fit in. They might require summer classes or really big semesterly workloads. I wouldn't say you need to worry about it your first semester, but when you meet with your departmental advisor they'll be able to help steer you in the right direction \n\n5. Connecting with people on campus is so important. Join a club so you have some kind of support system. Make friends with teachers/ your advisor to help you find industry jobs. Find a study buddy (or a few) for your core major classes that have similar intelligences/work ethics/ etc. as you, because it's so much easier to get stuff done well and effectively when you have other people to hold you accountable\n\nGood luck buddy :)",

FWIW, just judging from what the course catalog says, 111 *might* spend a lot of time covering stuff you already know.\n\nI would **highly** recommend you take up Russ Feldhausen's offer to chat. He's one of the best CS teachers I had and is really easy to talk to. He'd definitely know more about 111 than I would.",

You still need to keep your GPA up, but I found it less stressful going through those classes knowing that it was only temporary stress that wouldn't affect me long-term.\n\nAlso, get in good with an advisor that you like (and other professors in ME). They have all sorts of professional connections, stories, and experiences that can help you figure out what to do with your career.\n\nTake classes with Dr. Wanklyn if he's still around, I had him for Thermodynamics. Tough but fair teacher, incredible personality, and actually cares about his students.\n\nJoin at least one club so that you have a bigger support structure while you're here, and a distraction from your classes if you need them.\n\nI hope this helps!

He is remembering the way it never was. I lost points on assignments and discussion boards because I challenged this thinking.\n\nFor example, in one of his lectures, he was describing how nice things were in the 90s when you had to go somewhere, and instead of using GPS, you would go into a gas station and ask for directions. The way I remember this time, was being lost in the bad part of town and my friends and I screaming at each other because nobody knew the way out, and large groups of shady looking people were hanging out in gas station parking lots.\n\nHe seems to hate technology, and myself, at almost 40, I love technology and embrace it completely, it has changed our world for the better, but he goes on and on about how wonderful New Guinea is because they don't use technology.\n\nIn one of the assignments, students had to walk up to random strangers and ask them personal questions about their lives. When I challenged this and said this might not be a good idea for some of the younger traditional college women to do, it was met with \"bad stuff doesn't happen in Manhattan\".......I assure you bad stuff does happen in Manhattan.\n\nHis weird podcast thing about \"sneaking into a college party for anthropology reasons\" struck me the wrong way, trust me dude, a 40 year-old at a college party will stand out, you aren't tricking anyone.\n\nThese are just my experiences, if you guys enjoy his class I'm happy for you and glad you are getting something out of it. It was a requirement for my degree. I ended up with a 95% in his class.",

I know that would have been really hard for me.\n\nOnly you can make the final decision. First look into if a transfer is even feasible: Look into the financials, look into the application deadlines, all of that fun admin stuff. Depending on the outcome, you may not even really have a decision to make.\n\nNext, think about why you're drawn to Iowa so much. Remember, the grass is always greener on the other side of the fence. What makes you think that you'll not have the same issues when you get to Iowa City? You mentioned you came in 'cold' as a transfer with no friends. This is likely why you aren't 'feeling' the town. This feeling may persist with you during the transfer. I would try and put myself out there: join clubs, sports, live with roommates, etc (something I wish I did more in uni). Also, trust me, this only gets more difficult when you graduate and move cities for your job. Making friends is a skill: it takes effort and practice, it can be awkward, but it's very worth it.\n\nI never 'loved' Manhattan: I grew up in Kansas and I wanted to leave as soon as I could, and I really like big cities. My dream school was UT Austin, but it just wasn't realistic. Hell if I would have transferred there I would have partied my face off and probably gotten kicked out. I have no regrets, I loved my time at KState, and Manhattan is a 'cool' college town - there is certainly fun to be had. You can always have your dream school in your pocket as that second school you root for. Or, you can even do some post grad study there. \n\nHope that helps in some way! Best of luck.",

The are around campus is very geared towards the University and college students. Everything is very accessible by a short walk or bike ride and there is some bus service to hubs. During the school day you will see hundreds or thousands of students walking to class, getting a bite to eat, or heading off to wherever they are going. \n\nYou will probably have a shock when you first get to Manhattan but i bet if you spent a few months at K-State you\u2019d find yourself missing things from MHK. It\u2019s easy to find stuff to do and people are friendly but nobody is going to force you to go out and have fun either. It will be, like most places, what you make of it.

There's people from all over the world here and there's a place for everyone, but it still gets quiet after the bars close. It's a happy medium and you might just find you really enjoy it. As a lifelong townie, I'm not sure I could live anywhere else, but I'm biased. Your mileage may vary, of course, but there are MUCH smaller towns with colleges that I feel pretty safe saying someone like yourself wouldn't fit in in. Manhattan's not that.",

Chakrabarti, Law, and Berg at various points in my time there.\n\nA few things about Manhattan:\n\n* [Aggieville](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Aggieville/@39.1856216,-96.5766105,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x87bdd27847d8ad39:0xafd51091ba72cc60!8m2!3d39.1856175!4d-96.5744218) is the main eating/drinking area in Manhattan and is located a block to the southeast of campus. [Downtown](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Downtown/@39.1794011,-96.5634811,18z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x87bdd2622793f9b9:0xdda4b5d99df0913d!8m2!3d39.179399!4d-96.5623868) is coming into its own, though. There's a lot of really good places around town, but they're mostly concentrated in these areas. \n\n* [Auntie Mae's](https://www.auntiemaes.com/) in Aggieville is the best bar in Manhattan, in my opinion. During non-pandemic times, they'll have trivia, open mic, music, horrible movie nights, drag shows, bingo, etc., as well as the best bar staff. If you want to go to a good townie bar (townie described elsewhere here), try Finn's. Good drinks, (almost entirely) friendly people, and multiple pool tables and darts machines. \n\n* If you want Brooklyn-ish style pizza, go to Hi-Lo in Aggieville or A.J.'s in downtown (same owner, but Hi-Lo serves fantastic drinks and is much better for socializing. You will have to buy [Pizza Shuttle](http://www.pizzashuttle.org/) at some point, though. Sorry, it's a rule. I'd suggest the Santa Fe with jalapenos.\n\n* There is some [public transportation](https://www.rileycountyks.gov/1664/Routes-Services#:~:text=The%20aTa%20Bus%20serves%20all,the%20Green%20Valley%20and%20St.). It's not too bad to get around town on public transportation, but you have to plan ahead. You can also bike but there's several hills, mostly on campus and the west and north sides of town, that can make that difficult. I'd suggest you have a car.\n\n* For late nights, [Safe Ride](https://www.k-state.edu/student-involvement/saferide/) exists with free or discounted rides for students via Lyft from 11 pm to 3 am.\n\n* Grocery stores are either all the way to the east near Fort Riley Blvd (Hy-Vee, Walmart, Dillons) or west off of Sethchild (Dillons and Target). Depending on where you find a place to stay, you'll do most of your shopping either on the west or east side of town. Fast food is similarly split up, though there's a few places (Burger King, Popeye's, Starbucks) in Aggieville.\n\n* Weather: It's Kansas. We get the best and worst of it all. Expect snow and ice storms in the winter and hot, extremely humid days in the summer. And hail, high winds, tornadoes, etc. Depending on the age of your vehicle, I might suggest comprehensive insurance.",

Do your own research and ask questions, but you're not going to get a good response by posing this in a presumptive way.\n\nIf you want my two cents - all big state colleges are pretty much the same, and really the only thing that should matter to you is your goals and how they fit with *what you will learn* at the college. If you want to be a sports journalist, go to *the best* sports journalism program at any big state school you an get into. Period. Doesn't matter where it's at because, as I said, all big state schools are the same. \n\nYou're gonna live in a dorm with people you just met, all call yourselves [insert team name here], root for said team, go to football and basketball games, and on and on. Doesn't matter. What matters if the sports journalism career you hope to spend the next 50 years in - and whether you come out of a 2nd rate program writing copy at a dying newspaper, or a 1st rate program working for ESPN.  It's your choice. Forget about what teams you enjoy now, or which coach you respect. Those guys will be retired or dead by the time you're in your 30's. Think about *your* future, research it, commit to it, and don't ask other people about the college - focus in on the sports journalism programs and find people to talk to about those.",

I thought this was hilarious when I saw it but after 2 years there I think it was totally accurate. I don't regret my time in Manhattan at all. It was not a bad place to live and go to school. But that's about all I can say for it. Kansas is empty, flat, and pretty boring. There isn't much to dislike but there isn't much to like either because at the end of the day there just isn't much. (To be fair, Manhattan is in the flint hills which is not flat and is the only really beautiful part of Kansas, so that is a positive)",

They will help them, stay late to work with them, etc.  I do feel the campus is family.  I found plenty to do and loved the town, lake, etc.  I didn't find the drive in to Kansas City for concerts or Chief's games bad at all.  (ok in TX we are user to long drives).  \n\nThe weather was nice to me.  I loved getting snow and having seasons.  The campus is conservative but not overwhelming.  I had lots of very liberal friends.  Masters is a little different than undergrad.  The teams work very well together.  If you can come visit.  In person tours are available now.  It is really a nice place to go to school.  There are lots of events on campus and in the town.  Even now it isn't totally dead!

I think the only bad think would be winter time is kind of rough when walking to class. I could never get parking in the parking lots around campus so I just always used the parking garage and if you have a class all the way across campus, its a tough walk in the winter. Campus is BEAUTIFUL in the fall and spring though. Its pretty close to Kansas City, only about 2 hours, thats where I live now.\n\nI saw your comment about dating apps. Fort Riley is less than 30 minutes away and I know a lot of people who have used Tinder to find people. My sister met her boyfriend whos at Fort Riley on Tinder.

        "body": "Yes. So we currently pay the campus privilege fee of ~$470, and that covers the rec and other services. We also pay the normal tuition rate for these courses, about $340/credit hour. And then, on top of that rate, we are also being charged an extra $70/hour, so nearly $410/credit hour for courses that were supposed to be in person when we enrolled, but have now transitioned online. For me, this has the added cost of $630 because I had 3 courses transition to online. I\u2019ve seen other students with additional fees of > $1000 depending on the individual college (engineering, arts and sci., etc.).",

        "body": "I\u2019m not sure the announcement was clear about the fee being added on top of regular tuition. But if I check my KSIS, my tuition charge is correct for 15 hours at the regular tuition rate, and then I have an entirely separate charge listed as \u201cCollege of A&S Online Fee\u201d that is $630 (so 9 hours, and that is correct bc 3 of my A&S courses have just transferred online after originally being in person). So it is most definitely being tacked on as an extra added fee, which I would understand had I originally signed up for these courses online. But shifting them from in-person to online and NOW charging extra fees feels a bit scummy (especially since professors are receiving reduced salaries this year, so that money is not going to them). I get that the University is facing financial struggles, but imo the weight of that entire burden should not be put on the students.\n\nRealistically, will this petition convince the admin to change their decision? Probably not. And I acknowledge that it is most definitely safer for the courses to be shifted online due to COVID. But what doesn\u2019t make sense to me is the purpose of these charges. They\u2019re not going to professors. They don\u2019t need to go towards facilities since courses will be conducted via Zoom/Canvas (software that is already paid for and licensed). So where is this money going?",

Ok, I saw your comment later on and talked to a colleague and it is vague in the announcement. \n\nThe university is actually losing money by reducing the fees. Online does cost more beyond Zoom and Canvas; for one, asynchronous lectures have to be hosted via mediasite (through Canvas). They also have to adjust for more people accessing online resources than predicted (increased load on servers). We have around 25,000 students. Putting all of them online costs a lot.\n\nI get that it sucks. I work in student affairs and see a lot of students' difficulties due to high tuition and fees. There are frustrating campus fees (charging grad students doing research hours a course enhancement fee?) But I do not see this is as a for-profit gesture. Why not contact the provost's office and ask about the $70/hour fee? It's good to have questions, but assuming one already has the answers isn't the next step.",

I know the University of Kansas has been utilizing YouTube with private URLs for lecture videos - that could potentially be a cheaper alternative to Mediasite (but to be honest, I\u2019m not entirely sure how that works internally).\n\nI plan on reaching out to the provost\u2019s office, so thank you for that advice. More transparency would be much appreciated.\n\nFrom our perspective as students, it does feel like we\u2019re being punished, in a way, for something that is completely out of our control (well, for the most part, I can\u2019t vouch for others practicing/not practicing social distancing habits). I\u2019m also personally in a tough situation because I\u2019m in my last two semesters, so I am unable to switch out of the online courses for in-person courses since I\u2019m nearly finished with my degree and need every credit that I\u2019m enrolled in. \n\nI also acknowledge that the University needs to stay afloat, and tough decisions like this one have to be made.

        "body": "I agree that it\u2019s a bad idea but keep in mind that sports are pretty much the main reason we\u2019re going back in person. They\u2019re huge for funding and having even the chance for in-person classes will bring a lot of students back. It\u2019s fucked but schools all over are hurting for money and some may very well close. People all over the country, hell, people I know personally, have said that they aren\u2019t going to pay big money to take online classes so it\u2019s not like schools like K-State can really afford to not hold in-person classes. Again, I want to reiterate, I don\u2019t think that justifies this. I am very much so not comfortable with in-person classes, as much as I hate online ones. I think it\u2019s gonna end up getting people sick but this is a decision that K-State very likely will not back out of until at least the school year has started. \n\nThis is true. I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s justified, it does suck. Honestly though, if you\u2019re paying for an apartment, it\u2019s actually cheaper to not live there as long as you\u2019re not paying for a second one. That said, it really does blow to have an apartment I barely ever live in, even if it\u2019s just for the summer.",

I think there was a data dump of racist groups' chat messages where somebody claimed they had put up posters at several Kansas universities, but it's been long enough since that news broke that I'm not finding it by googling. I think it was also unclear if or where they were attending college.\n\nI will say that you'd be unlikely to even know that bulletin board existed unless you were familiar with Seaton and had reason to be there, but it's also possible it was just a target of opportunity. The Denison poster was at the street crossing between Goodnow and the rest of campus. Again, likely a target of opportunity.\n\nK-State ended up putting up cameras covering that entrance into Seaton a few months later because of a different incident where some students caused some damage (unrelated to racism) and also ended up locking most of the buildings doors at night except for where they had cameras.

I highly recommend finding one of these programs and getting involved. \n\nIn general, i typically say to find one design team, one career development program, and one or more fun extracurriculars to do. \n\nFinally, frats usually host tailgates before each football game, and then go to games as a group.

The \u201cpoint\u201d of the organization is allegedly to bring more conservatism to college campuses. Ironically it was started by a guy who never went to college and it\u2019s funded by billionaires who use the organization to promote their ideals specifically. \n\nHere are some quick bullet points:\n\n-at least one chapter has worked to bring Nick Fuentes, a far right media face who has had a history of ties with people such as Richard Spencer, to their campus. \n\n-a former higher-up, Candace Owens has made statements saying white nationalism isn\u2019t bad. \n\n-a former member has spent time working with Nick Fuentes and another far-right media member Baked Alaska\n\nAt lower levels, though it\u2019s generally not full white nationalism, there have been repeat instances of widespread racism, islamophobia, and xenophobia, with Charlie Kirk himself often pushing these ideas through his speeches and social media. Also beyond this, Kirk worked directly with Donald Trump during his time leading TPUSA, pretty much allowing a direct line of propaganda. \n\nSo pretty much, TPUSA is not necessarily white nationalist or really even far-right. In fact, Charlie Kirk (the head) tries to distance himself from right-wing fringe groups, to the point of clashing with many of them. It\u2019s that college-aged members and several higher-ups tend to have ties to these groups and that the organization (though maybe accidentally) attract far right people. Surface-level it sounds harmless but when you consider how huge the group actually is and who is behind it all, it becomes a lot clearer that we don\u2019t need anyone like this on our campus. \n\nHere are some sources:\n\n[MMFA](https://www.mediamatters.org/charlie-kirk/short-history-turning-point-usas-racism) \n\n[SPLC](https://www.splcenter.org/hatewatch/2018/02/16/turning-point-usas-blooming-romance-alt-right) \n\n[Huffington Post](https://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/us_5cd58fdbe4b0796a95dac4f6/amp) \n\n[Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turning_Point_USA)",

That being said, how these two movements have started to merge at the fringes is really worth examining.\n\nThe connections are being drawn due to white nationalist leaders' desire to reframe their movement in order to develop a stronger power base in the country. If you look at some of their primary spokespeople, they tend to be exceptionally attractive, well-spoken, clean-cut and just all-around likable people, until you start breaking down their message.\n\nAdd to this the open associations with white-supremecist groups, and the coded white supremacist ideals (such as AmericaFirst's founding idea that they want to \"fight against the globalist agenda). It falls in line with the idea that there is a group of Zionist Jews who are working towards world domination. \n\nJust as a very pertinent statement here: It is important to recognize that these white supremacist groups are all about using symbology and codes. It is a part of their culture. Bad stuff tends to happen to them when they are exposed. They are fired. They are shunned from society. So many seek to hide it. That is why watering it down, and encoding it as they are is so dangerous. I've been around this shit enough and paid enough attention to it to know it when I see it.",

There are direct and verified links between these movements and the basis of their ideologies and belief structures.\n\nThe one interesting thing here is that Christianity has been pulled in as a foundational principal, which does actually contradict classical national socialist beliefs. In fact, they reject spirituality outright in favor of symbolism. That being said, those values are absolutely anti-Christian until you approach the skews of that demographic, and that directly contradicts my assessment so far.",

The gathering ended with a white nationalist plowing his car into a group of counter-protesters, killing one.  \n>  \n>\u201cThis is an attempt to replace the old label of alt-right, which got pretty toxic after Charlottesville, and try to create new coalitions on university campuses and in and around the Trump orbit,\u201d said Devin Burghart, executive director of the institute and co-author of the 64-page report, From Alt-Right to Groyper: White Nationalists Rebrand for 2020 and Beyond.  \n>  \n>\u201cThose are the two main targets of recruitment for them right now.\u201d  \n>  \n>The strategy will have its trial run, Burghart said, at K-State, where the [formation of a new organization, America First Students](https://twitter.com/McNeilJaden/status/1219668596143677445/photo/1), was announced last month. The first meeting was Jan. 28, according to its Twitter account.  \n>  \n>America First Students is led by Jaden McNeil, a current student and former president of the K-State chapter of Turning Point USA, a conservative youth activist network. That organization was [the subject of protests on campus last year](https://themercury.com/news/education/protesters-conservative-speakers-clash-at-k-state/article_a58a4e0c-d0e7-558f-89c2-26d2e062a78f.html) by the KSU Young Democrats, which said Turning Point USA was associated with hateful rhetoric and called for the group to be removed from campus.  \n>  \n>K-State spokeswoman Michelle Geering said in an email that America First Students \u201cis an independent student organization registered with K-State\u2019s Center for Student Involvement.\u201d  \n>  \n>\u201cIndependent student organizations are not operated or controlled by the university,\u201d she said.  \n>  \n>McNeil did not respond to a request for comment on Tuesday. At the time of last year\u2019s protest, he said he wished the two sides could come to an understanding.  \n>  \n>\u201cInstead of having a protest I wish they could come and discuss our differences because we have a lot more in common then they believe,\u201d he said.  \n>  \n>McNeil and other TPUSA officers resigned from the K-State chapter in October. McNeil said in an Oct. 31 tweet that he was parting ways with the organization because \u201cTPUSA constantly cedes cultural ground to the Left.\u201d  \n>  \n>Now, the report says, McNeil has joined forces with Nick Fuentes and Pat Casey, whom the institute describes as white nationalists. Fuentes is a far-right YouTuber and podcaster, and Casey is head of the American Identity Movement, formerly known as [Identity Evropa, a white nationalist organization](https://www.kansascity.com/news/state/kansas/article105980767.html) known for distributing racist propaganda on college campuses in the past few years. Both Fuentes and Casey attended the deadly Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville.  \n>  \n>Fuentes and Casey announced the formation of America First Students at a [\u201cGroyper Leadership Summit\u201d](https://twitter.com/nickjfuentes/status/1201564312290123776?lang=en) in Florida in December, praising McNeil\u2019s efforts.  \n>  \n>\u201cGroyper\u201d is the name of a far-right meme based on a cartoon toad \u2014 the latest mutation of the Pepe the Frog meme, a symbol used by Trump supporters and co-opted by white nationalists.  \n>  \n>\u201cFrom day one, the \u2018Groypers\u2019 have been as slippery as the toad for which they are named \u2014 an ever-changing effort to obfuscate their ideology and keep white nationalism germane inside MAGA world and the GOP,\u201d said IREHR research director, Charles Tanner.  \n>  \n>As part of their strategy to become more mainstream, the report says, the \u201cGroypers\u201d are holding an \u201cAmerica First Political Action Conference\u201d in Washington, D.C., at the end of the month to coincide with the Conservative Political Action Conference.  \n>  \n>Last month, Fuentes congratulated McNeil on the launch of America First Students at Kansas State.  \n>  \n>\u201cThis project has amazing potential to rally American Nationalists and real conservatives on campus\u2026 ,\u201d Fuentes said in a tweet. \u201cI am very excited to see what comes next for AFS this year!\u201d  \n>  \n>Fuentes and Casey could not be reached for comment Tuesday but have denied being white nationalists. The IREHR says evidence shows otherwise.  \n>  \n>\u201cThey\u2019ll say this is just liberals trying to taint them, that they\u2019re just traditionalist conservatives who support Christian values,\u201d Burghart said. \u201cBut all of the key leadership, the influencers, hold ideals that any rational person would categorize as white nationalist.  \n>  \n>\u201cFuentes and Casey both represent this new generation of white nationalists. It\u2019s a whole new ballgame. These aren\u2019t millennials. This is white nationalism for the Zoomer generation.\u201d  \n>  \n>McNeil has described America First Students as \u201ca campus conservative organization defined by our support for closed borders, traditional families, the American worker, and Christian values.\u201d  \n>  \n>He added that \u201cConservatism Inc. has brainwashed many students into believing that globalist policies \u2014 particularly free trade and mass immigration \u2014 constitute conservatism, when clearly they do not.\u201d He said America First Students would advocate for \u201cthe broader goal of defending America against globalism, affirming the vision laid out by President Trump in his inaugural address.\u201d  \n>  \n>The organization plans to start chapters at other universities as well, according to its Twitter account.  \n>  \n>\u201cWe\u2019re going to focus on the Kansas State AFS chapter before branching out to other campuses,\u201d it says.  \n>  \n>And on Feb. 5 Fuentes tweeted: \u201cI am exploring the possibility of an America First college tour this Spring. There are several events in the works already\u2026\u201d  \n>  \n>Burghart said while it\u2019s too soon to tell whether America First Students is a white nationalist organization, \u201cthey\u2019re promoting an agenda aligned with white nationalism.\u201d  \n>  \n>\u201cBut given that they\u2019re participating in the larger Groyper activity, it\u2019s definitely a sign of concern.\u201d",

Don't get me started on house parties, either. The not-insignificant benefit to KU is being less than an hour from KC. Many KU students drive to KC and hit up Westport than stay in Lawrence. Regardless, both MHK and LFK are awesome in their unique ways.\n\nAlso, laughing a bit at your diversity comment \u2014 it's really not much different between the two schools. And for a while K-State's was probably more so with their study abroad relationships. In fact, from a LGBTQ+ perspective, K-State ranked higher than KU on \"friendliness\" this past year.

Since you\u2019re coming in as a transfer student though, you might not be as interested in that \u201ctraditional college freshman experience\u201d. If that\u2019s the case, I\u2019d say Wefald would be a good place - it\u2019s new, a little unique in design compared from others (kitchen on every floor, individual bathrooms but shared with others, more nooks to sit and hang out in). But there are other great dorms too. I think Marlatt and Goodnow have a chill but fun vibe. Putnam and Van Zile seem to have a close, tight knit community feel. I\u2019ve heard good things about West too.\n\nJardine apartments are a little more of a walk from where classes will be, but not much, and there\u2019s a shuttle you can take too. The numbered buildings (1-13) are pretty nice, and some are in really cool neighborhoods that overlook a nice pond area. 14-16 are the newest and are really nice and have a good amount of space. The lettered buildings (like S, V) are older and a bit smaller with not quite as nice kitchens, but a lot have been renovated recently and might have nicer interiors now. They can still have a cozy atmosphere though if you set them up right. In all apartments, you\u2019ll have to pay for electricity but I\u2019m pretty sure the rest of the utilities and campus internet (which is pretty good now) are included.\n\nI\u2019d say go the dorms if you want to be forced to meet people, but if you\u2019ve already got friends established or don\u2019t want to be with primarily freshmen/sophomores and want more privacy, go for the apartments. Hope that helps some, let me know if you have questions!\n\nedit: just read you\u2019re a chem major, so most of your classes will probably be on the east side of campus. VanZile, Putnam, West, and the other Derby dorms are closer, but still not a far walk from the dorms on the west side like Marlatt, Goodnow, Wefald. From Jardine, I\u2019d say it\u2019s a 20 minute walk, or <5 minutes walk from where the shuttle drops you off at.",

Some professors may personally cancel class, or post an online lecture. Just need to ask.\n\nEdit: After posting, I realized my top sentences sounded kind of shitty. But what I mean by that it's K-State won't cancel for something like that. I'm in engineering so some professors literally have to teach material and squeeze it into a semester or risk losing ABET accreditation, which is vital for the college of engineering and students graduating to get jobs in industry. That's why they leave it up to professors. Some professors could give two shits about sports and won't budge and may even require students to be there. It just depends.",

It is not very high level in the calculus aspect, the challenge comes from the proof part. It is a very difficult class and I consider myself good at math. \n\n511 is a much easier course but is also proof focused. It has no real connection to calculus however but it will be a much easier choice if you don't have much experience with proofs. It was also one of my favorite math classes I have taken.\n\nPersonally, I wouldn't take 520. I managed to complete it with a B, but I can't say I really grasped many of the concepts. My professor, Marianne Korten, was also not the best. She really moved the material quickly, and I had to spend a lot of time learning the concepts outside of class.\n\nHope this helps. Good luck.",

You will do nothing but studio and some days you won\u2019t have time to eat, shower, or sleep. It gets less intense after freshman year but is still a huge time commitment. For example, my boyfriend majored in computer science and took 18 credit hour semesters and worked 30 hours a week and I did more school than he did school and work. By a lot. Having that said, the projects you work on can be really cool, the friends are great, and architecture is slightly less time consuming than interior architecture (although any architect would not admit that haha). Feel free to DM me any questions. My best advice to to intern/shadow at a few firms and get a sense of the work you will actually be doing. It\u2019s not what most people think it is. Good luck!",

        "body": "IAPD alum. \n\nIt is a good program and if you stick it out the people you study with will become extended family. Also know that the first couple years are grueling for several reasons that vary depending on how you function. Not to scare you off, but first couple semesters expect half the class to drop.\n\nCampus housing is great for the first year, make new friends and become roommates off campus later. Community floors are much more social than suites, it's much easier to meet like minded people. \n\nHighly recommend getting involved with other student groups outside of Seaton if you can. Broadens your circles and gets you to see daylight outside of studio! Rowed for the Men's crew(FYI women are allowed as well, non NCAA) and got to meet all sorts of other majors while working out.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGood luck! EMAW!",

Son lived in dorm first semester of freshman year and then moved into a fraternity house after making a lot of friends and meeting his gf.\n3. Agree that parking permit doesn't mean you can find parking.  We are from way OOS so S needed a car.  First semester was a pain.  Parking at the frat house has been so much easier for him and he hasn't bought a parking pass since.  People are great and campus is very friendly.  Get involved, clubs, Greek, etc.  You can be Greek and get good/excellent grades in very difficult programs (if not we parents would have quit paying for it!).  But you don't have to be Greek to have a great time on campus.\n\nMom of a Junior here.  We are very happy with the school and think he made a great decision to go there.",

You should not go into rush thinking \"this house is full of dorks because my sister said so\" or \"this is where the cool girls are because my boyfriend's best friend is dating one,\" or I want to be in this house because I saw a really pretty girl wearing a party shirt this summer. You need to really have no previous opinions, except maybe if you are a legacy. This is also why the rush counselors don't tell you what house they are in. \n\nGuys do rush differently than we do. They are not exposed to any houses unless they want to be. We are introduced to all the houses regardless of any preconceived notions. I could tell you right now which houses were full of snobby girls in 1988 and it may be totally different now, and it can differ between campuses. \n\nJust meet the girls and fit in where you feel comfortable. Don't try to figure out what houses are the \"good\" houses or the \"smart\" houses or the \"sporty\" houses because you will spend 4 years with these people. \n\nMy sister was a Pi Beta Phi at KSU back in 1989, and that was fine, but she transferred to Pi Phi at KU and I swear to god those were the most stuck up, rudest people I have ever met. \n\nI have met girls from my sorority at different houses and have liked them all for the most part. \n\nWhen you are graduated and in the real world, no one will care what house you were in. What will matter is what you learn from being in the Greek system, from table manners to presenting yourself professionally, and making lifelong acquaintances.

We are supporters of kstate, and everybody is telling you to not take maths there.\n\nThey are all set up in a pattern of first- and third-day (like Mon and Wed) lectures in a big auditorium with two or three hundred other students. Hard to see everything that's written on the board unless you get there early to get a decent seat. It's hard to even get there early because there will be another class in that auditorium that doesn't dismiss until 10 minutes before your class starts. The hallways in Calvin Hall are extremely crowded before and after class.\n\nOn the 2nd and 4th days (like tues and thurs) there is \"recitation\", a smaller class of 30 or so that is supposed to cover the lecture topic from the day before in greater detail and assign homework. I was 0 for 3 on my recitation teachers. I had a Chinese grad student with an accent so thick I couldn't understand him, but he was the best of them. After him, I had the angriest old man I've ever known, who used to berate several students each class for not understanding math well enough. Seriously. His name was Alexander Ramm. After him, I had another very angry man who would berate anyone he felt wasn't paying close enough attention. He chewed me out once for reading the collegian newspaper several minutes before class even started.\n\nSo yeah, I know you think you can't do it at a community college, but you can. Put it off and take it in a year or two. Don't be a full-time student when you take it over the summer. Or look into taking it as a distance (online) course from somewhere transferable. \n\nOr maybe just rethink the whole architecture thing. I know a ton of people who started in the program or changed majors to it, but I don't know a single person who graduated the program. They all switched to something else. A required 5th year means you're paying 20% more for college, and also graduating a year later when all your friends have already made 40 or 50 or 60k in the year you've been finishing up. Plus the job market is tough for architects. You won't be designing skyscrapers and public buildings, you'll be lucky to land a job designing renovation work for old run down buildings.\n\nAnyway, sorry to poop all over everything, I think it's very commendable to have some direction at your age. I had no idea what to do or major in the summer before my freshmen year. If you want time to consider other options, ask your orientation advisor if you can just enroll with an undeclared major and take gen eds for a semester or two. You'll meet a lot of people your first year and find out about majors you didn't even know existed.",

I\u2019m sure you can find another class to take in the fall, or even consider taking public speaking (an easy A) this fall to boost your GPA and to take the college algebra class this summer since transfer credits don\u2019t affect your KSU GPA. \n\nEven if you don\u2019t live in another CC\u2019s county (if you take it online) it will still probably be cheaper than taking the class at KSU. I took Calc 1 last summer at my local CC so I didn\u2019t have to do any math classes for my degree at KSU. \n\n\nI agree with others about the difficulty of math classes at KSU, I took physics last semester and struggled a lot, and I\u2019ve heard quite a bit from my friends about the math classes not being set up or taught well.

None of this is unique to Kstate. \n\nMy recommendation is to take traditional college algebra.

Cheaper rent might sound great, but parking is an absolute nightmare in Manhattan. Parking passes are expensive and definitely offset that cheaper rent.

They're pretty much identical to any other Kroger-style grocery store. There are 4 (I think) Around town. \n\nManhattan is near a military base called Fort Riely. \"Riely rats\" are soldiers on leave, typically causing trouble in aggieville, or racing the cars they paid too much for. They're pretty annoying but not an everyday encounter either. Couple times a month. \n\nThe new movie theater is pretty great. \n\nIf you're an outdoorsman KS might disappoint. But the Konza is a pretty sight at sunset. \n\nThe spork statue will randomly have babies. This is considered normal and no cause for alarm. \n\nThe National Bio Ag Defence Facility will probably (finally) be up and running while you're there. It's supposed to double the size of Manhattan by 2025. (From 30,000 year round residents to 60,000) so Manhattan is expecting a good amount of growth in the near future. \n\nIf you like canoeing you almost certainly have to wait till after a good rain. Our rivers aren't deep. \n\nI don't know what Idaho weather is like, KS gets hot in the summer (weeks on end all over 100F) and pretty cold in the winter (down to around 0) we also get more ice than snow when it's cold. Although the area tends to be pretty dry overall. \n\nThat's all I can think of at the moment. But I'd be happy to answer any other questions.",

Do you enjoy hanging around boys or do you prefer hanging around with girls?\n\nHere\u2019s some info on each community with a little background on each. I lived in Moore 2 years, Wefald 1 year, had a girlfriend in Ford for 1 year, and a girlfriend in Boyd (all female) for 1 year.\n\nWefald:\n\nPros:\nGood area if you\u2019re an engineering major. Very close to engineering building, fairly close to the union. New everything is nice, Kramer dining is very cool. Rooms are wood floors, larger than average dorm room, large walk in closet with a lot of space. Both women and men so diverse relationships. Can possibly live in co-Ed hall which is a unique experience. Coffee shop and dining complex literally downstairs. \n\nCons: \nVery much fits the stereotypes of snarky rich kids. Community tends to be less social than the other halls (minus Ford, Boyd) so a lot of people keeping to themselves. Most expensive hall. Depending on your major can be inconvenient as it\u2019s clear across campus from Business, Bluemont, Hale, Dickens, etc. \n\nFord:\n\nPros:\nMost women here are freshmen in sororities so if you\u2019re in a sorority you\u2019ll be in good company. Largest female community hall by numbers. Very close to business, bluemont, Hale, etc. Derby dining complex is larger and runs more efficiently than Kramer. \n\nCons:\nIf you\u2019re not in a sorority and don\u2019t find men to be a distraction I\u2019d avoid Ford. The community tends to be reclusive (my girlfriend never even met her neighbors all year). Most people will be confined in their rooms, not in social common areas unlike other dorms. Far away from engineering, Calvin, Nichols, union, etc.\n\nAlternative but I\u2019ve heard great things about Marlett, Goodnow, and Haymaker. I\u2019m biased but if I could do it over again I\u2019d choose Moore hall every time. Largest hall (by numbers), one of the most active communities, and very close to things important to me. Not one of the newest halls, but that\u2019s okay for me. I\u2019d recommend going on tours and asking around to find out what works best for you, your needs, personality, etc. hope this helps and good luck! You\u2019ll love it there at KSU!",

I would imagine a home court feeling for UC Irvine.\n\nAt then end of the day, these teams aren\u2019t to different. Both play good defense, both have upperclassmen leadership. We have the overall better defense, but UC Irvine is better at protecting the rim. This could really hurt Makol Mawien. \n\nOverall, if we have Dean Wade, I\u2019d say we\u2019ll have the win.

Many times I've had fantastic service, but several, including my first time there, it has been pretty flaky, and this is largely due to the lack of experience of some of the staff, so I have not raised much of a fuss about it.  \n\n\nWhen it comes to pricing, the overhead to be in the student union must be pretty insane.

It gets pretty hectic around game days and local holidays but otherwise it's a pretty quiet town. People are generally really nice. I've never felt unsafe. \n\nNegatives would be that compared to other similar sized towns in Kansas the rent is high. But still well below the national average.

Limited things to do, and one of my big cons here is ease of travel. Manhattan airport is very small (5-6 flights a day) and only flies to Dallas or Chicago and tickets are often a lot more expensive. While Kansas City airport has more options: it's still small for an international airport, it's a two hour drive away, and frankly it's a dump. \n\nManhattan is quiet and safe, and cost of living is low. With a half decent funding offer you shouldn't have much trouble making ends meet here. But that comes with there not being a ton of things to do. I will say for the size of the town there's a decent variety of locally owned restaurants. \n\nIn my opinion it's a pretty campus too, though venturing onto main campus has always been a rarity for me.",

I'm not going to post much about the town's atmosphere in general because I'm from a rural area and so Manhattan is (by my standards) a large urban center.\n\nK-State's Chemistry Department is not only quite small for a school of its size but, sadly, very poorly funded and at times lacks the state-of-the-art instruments that, say, Nebraska-Lincoln or KU have (the worst offender for that was the NMR facilities but thankfully they're installing a new machine this coming week). The actual quality of facilities you'd be working in varies quite a bit though, depending on how much grant money your research group has (or has had in the recent past); because of this it might be helpful to know if you know who's group you'd be joining. \n\nThat being said, the relatively small size of the Chem department has (from my perspective) allowed a fairly strong community to grow. As an undergrad, both the graduate students and the faculty are very friendly and approachable (which was not the case when I was a summer visiting scholar at another large Midwestern public university that shall remain nameless). In addition, from my understanding, the department is able to produce and publish more impactful research than most of the other Big XII universities in spite of its limitations.\n\nFor what its worth, I am not planning to attending grad school immediately after getting my bachelor's and would rather wait a few years. However, from having looked a bit at graduate programs K-State is not my first choice, but it wouldn't be my last choice either.\n\nFeel free to let me know if you have any questions.",

The campus was conservative compared to GVSU so it's going to feel hyper conservative compared to Michigan. \n\n\nIf you're expecting Manhattan to be anything like Ann Arbor you'll be disappointed. Manhattan is really a island in the middle of a state that is sparsely populated outside of the Kansas City Metro area. When I was a student about ten years ago there wasn't a wide selection of food outside of things like the olive garden, kfc, and other middle of the road restaurants. \n\nAggieville is a cool area but it's almost always overrun with undergrads. If you end up teaching as I did, it's hard to find bar where you won't run into students. Mae's was about the only place that I could have a beer in peace. \n\nNow there are some cool things about KSU too. Even though it's a large school, it still feels pretty small. I got to know a lot of people outside my grad program which was cool. I would, however, strongly urge you to make the best decision based on your program. Have you been offered funding? If so was the funding package competitive? What swayed me into attending KSU is that they waived my tuition, offered me a GTA position, and awarded me a sizable scholarship. It was really hard for me to say no to their package compared to other schools. In all, I'm super happy that I attended there. \n",

If you like the outdoors, then you can find plenty to do in the surrounding Flint Hills. I actually commute from a smaller town because my partner and I have a house and he works for a different university full time, whereas I am just a student and GRA and only go to campus a couple days a week. We do a lot of a outdoor hiking/biking and enjoy traveling to the weird towns and places Kansas has to offer. Seriously- check out Weird Kansas and The Kansas Guide for Explorers pt. 2. \n\nKSU tries to offer a lot of things for students of all ages and that\u2019s kinda fun. For example, Tuesday there was a free talk by Pete Souza (White House photographer for Reagan/Obama) and it was awesome. The campus does feel a lot more conservative than the private school I went to for undergrad (in another part of KS), which is weird, but you\u2019ll find plenty of non-conservatives here. \n\nUltimately, as a grad student, you\u2019re not going to have the same schedule with the same freedoms as an undergrad because workload/lab (I\u2019m assuming since you\u2019re in Chem)/ and teaching if you\u2019re offered a GTA position. Pick the program that works for you, your financials, and will make you happy - you\u2019ll find your place in the town/city/campus no matter where it\u2019s at. Also, grad school is a finite amount of time compared to the rest of your life; it\u2019s good to remember that you don\u2019t HAVE to live forever in the place your school is in.",

Where OP is from there is a ton more variety and a lot higher quality restaurants than you\u2019ll find in Manhattan in the same way that Kansas City has far more to offer than Manhattan. \n\nedit: I don't typically comment if one of my comments is downvoted because it's not really a productive thing to do but, I'm going to break that trend here. For a lot of kids at KSU, Manhattan IS a large metro area given they've come from small town Kansas. Unless you're from one of the seven cities that are larger than Manhattan, Manhattan will feel large and diverse to you. The area that OP currently lives in is much, much, much larger than Manhattan and has a lot more to food, entertainment, and diversity options to offer. This isn't necessarily a knock on Manhattan, but it is true nonetheless. This is information that I wish that I had prior to attending school there. \n\nTo be fair form searching Yelp it looks like there are currently 3 Thai, 2 Sushi, and 7 Mexican restaurants in the area now so there are more offerings than bar food and middle of the road american fare. Harry's is still there which is nice, but there hasn't been a lot of fine dining development. \n\nLike I said in another comment, I enjoyed my time in Manhattan and would be happy to raise my family there.

When I was a grad student I spent a lot of my time at departmental events with other grad students. I imagine you'd end up doing the same. As other's have mentioned, don't expect to have the same social life that you had as an undergrad while you're a grad student. If you're doing grad school right, you're going to be far more busy than you've ever been in the past. \n\nSports are totally different because KSU is a Big 12 school and not a D2 GLIAC school. I was only able to make it to a couple of football games but they were a ton of fun. The basketball games were a lot more fun because they're shorter and they don't take up your entire day. The octagon of doom is an awesome venue. When I was there the football and basketball teams were both really good so going to the games meant likely seeing a K-State win. The football team is not likely to be good next year while the basketball team will be in a bit of a reloading year. \n \nManhattan is to Kansas City as Allendale is to Grand Rapids so keep that in mind. I forgot to mention that Omaha isn't too far away either. My wife and I would take weekend trips to Omaha and Kansas City when we wanted to get out of town for a while. \n\nOne thing that no one prepared me for was the heat and humidity. Kansas is HOT and Humid in the summer. Like really, really, really hot and humid. I know that people from Michigan think that it's hot and humid there, but Michigan has nothing on Kansas. Another thing that I found surprising was how weird it felt to live in a land-locked state. I grew up near the lake so it felt odd to me to not be able to drive to the lake. \n\nI was offered a full-time job in my field at KSU after I graduated but I turned it down because I wanted to live in a far more metro area. I live in Southern CA now. Now that I'm older and have kids, I'd love to raise my family there. I won't ever be able to move back because KSU won't be able match my current salary adjusting for cost of living, but we visit every few years to catch a football game and to see friends who still live in the area and work at the university. \n\nIt's not a bad place to live/go to school, but you really have to know what you're getting into before you go. \n",

It was bad when Snyder for the first time threw his players under the bus when he said something along the lines to: \"I can't coach anyone who can't grow, x amount and can be faster.\"\n\nThompson just lacks the intuitiveness that most competent QB's have.

Activitywise Salina doesn't have all that, say, Manhattan has to offer since it's not a university town, but if you look hard enough you can find things to do around the area.

        "body": "Backstory: In 2015, the marching band did a Star Trek themed performance at the halftime of a football game and they assumed a formation where the USS Enterprise encounters a Jayhawk in space, described by the announcer as \"a terrifying space creature\". As the formation moved, it looked for all the world like the Jayhawk was eating a dick.\n\nIt was conclusively proven to be accidental when a band member posted their formation grid papers clearly showing that the Jayhawk was never meant to be shown eating a dick. It was just an unfortunate accidental consequence of how the people had to move on the field. Plus watching a video of the performance, you don't even see the dick. It moves by so fast and you only see it if you pause the video and watch it frame-by-frame.\n\nBut the damage was done and people on /r/kansas and /r/cfb still remember it as being deliberate. I've gotten hundreds of downvotes for trying to explain this to the world, but it's hopeless. People can't even get it through their skulls that they were doing a Star Trek themed performance, so \"it was supposed to be the USS Enterprise\" sounds like a cop out to them.",

Who\u2019s job is it to ensure we have the recruits to compete? I remember the Snyder 1 years and we absolutely had talented players coming to MHK.

Manhattan was HALF of what it is now on a good day!\n\nWe\u2019ve lost more than half of last years class, almost all of our WR depth who still had eligibility, and our 3rd string QB just left the program last week.

That\u2019s a pretty long list if you\u2019re just asking about between me and my opponent, but here are a few of my bigger ideas:\n\n* Adding a high-income earner tax bracket\n   * The top 1% of Kansans make over $350k/year, yet are in the same bracket as Kansans who make $60k/year\n* Passing common-sense gun legislation, including: \n   * Red-flag laws;\n   * Universal background checks; and\n   * Banning guns on college campuses.\n* Ensuring equality for all Kansans, including such measures as:\n   * Expanding existing anti-discrimination laws to allow any Kansas resident who is fired, kicked out of their home, or denied other rights for being a member of the LGBTQ+ community to fight back with litigation;\n   * Overturning the discriminatory adoption bill my opponent helped pass; and\n   * Expanding the Equal Pay Act, as done in Washington ([**https://www.fisherphillips.com/resources-alerts-equal-pay-for-equal-work-washington-updates**](https://www.fisherphillips.com/resources-alerts-equal-pay-for-equal-work-washington-updates))\n* Fully funding education\n   * That includes adding universal pre-K and restoring state funding to K-12 and higher education\n* As for my campaign, I\u2019m rejecting all PAC money. That way, when elected, I will be beholden only to my constituents, and not the toxic special interest, corporate money that played such a major role in landing us where we are today.\n   * On that note, if you have any policy priorities or concerns you want taken to the capitol, I\u2019m all ears.

I share that goal as one of my main platforms -- keeping the taxes that affect us lower- and middle-class Kansans flat, rather than increasing them again to bail out the failed Brownback tax experiments.\n\nI intend to make up our revenue shortfalls by adding a high-income earner tax bracket for the top earning 1% of our state, as well as increase taxes on larger corporations. That money would go toward things regular Kansans need, such as public and higher education and healthcare.\n\nI also want to implement a policy targeting corporations, like Walmart, that pay their CEOs more than 20x what they pay their average employees and have employees on public assistance. Under this policy, such companies would be required to reimburse the state for the public assistance used by their employees.",

Maybe it's [hours worked](https://www.bls.gov/opub/ted/2015/mobile/time-spent-working-by-full-and-part-time-status-gender-and-location-in-2014.htm), [career](https://www.the-american-interest.com/2016/05/09/men-and-women-choose-careers-differently/) [choice](http://gap.hks.harvard.edu/gender-competitiveness-and-career-choices), [family priority's](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/10/01/women-more-than-men-adjust-their-careers-for-family-life/), or maybe women choose [safer jobs](https://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2016/12/21/heres-your-gender-pay-gap-fatal-occupational-injuries/).\n\nEven after all of that let me lay out a scenario for you.  Say you own a business.  You are looking to hire a worker that will be the best fit. You have two applicants. One man and one woman. Both have equal education and experience. Both of them are in the mid 20s and married.  Given the statics are data available it would show for the same money the male would be the better choice given that statistically men work more hours, are more dedicated to their job, and due to biology will not need to be on leave for child care after birth. So given the law requiring both to be paid the same, and given that there is, statistically speaking, a greater return for hiring the male, the woman then is either not able to compete or your company will be worse off by having a lower return. \n\nJust like right now. Three weeks ago I had a child and my wife is currently home on maternity leave while I went back to work at the start of the next week and have been working overtime to stay caught up. \n\nIt is entirely possible that the entire world isn't sexist and that it's the choices people make that lead them to the result they have.

There is just more work involved in often unclean conditions. \n\nA society that works toward equality over freedom will end with neither equality nor freedom. \n\nI just feel with all of the problems that the state faces it may not be wise to spend time and effort chasing a problem that doesn't really exist anymore. \n\nIn closing I would just say thanks for responding instead of just ignoring like so often happens. \n",

Compared to other colleges, our bar scene is pretty limited but definitely shouldn't be overlooked. The BIN 612 has some the best bar food around with Gringo's and The Fountain making the best mixed drinks. Just across the street from them are Two Brothers Smoked Meats if you care much for BBQ and the like. I highly recommend going to either Bulldog Burger (burgers/grill) or Stromboli's (Pizza) down the street from the bars and getting the Freshmen 15 or Stromboli, respectively. Other places I recommend to eat in town include: La Terraza (Mexican), Little Dooey's (BBQ), Mugshots (burgers) and Umi (Japanese). \n\nOn Campus, you have to go to Mafes Creamery and get some Ice Cream and a wheel of cheese to bring back with you. Miss State makes all its own dairy products on campus. From there, stop by the Junction (right in front of the stadium) which is our major hub for tailgating before/after games. The Drill Field (named for its use by drilling cadets) is the center of campus with a huge open field surrounded by engineering row, The Mitchell Memorial Library, and the business school. \n\nOne last thing, BRING EARPLUGS if your going inside the stadium. We are one of the, if not the only school that is allowed artificial noise makers inside a stadium and we make the most of it with our cowbells. ",

        "body": "> tips for move-in day and packing for college\n\nBe careful of bringing more of your things than you actually need. Remember you have to share a very small room with another person and all the things they bring as well. When it comes to large or shared items (such as a mini-fridge, microwave, furniture, or a rug), contact your roommate in advance to make sure you don't double up on anything. Also, keep in mind that exposed heating elements are not allowed, so no toasters, griddles, or certain kinds of space heaters.\n\n>Are there any must-have items that most people forget?\n\nI don't know if these are commonly forgotten, but you should remember to bring a desk lamp, a laundry bag/basket, and a can of air freshener. I would also highly recommend a decently sized fan to help circulate the air when you have your windows or door open, or to keep yourself cool if you and your roommate can't agree on a thermostat setting (that was the one point of contention with my freshman year roommate).\n\nUnless you know you'll be visiting home before cold weather starts to roll in, bring a coat or at least a light jacket.\n\n>what time is the best time to move in?\n\nAs early as possible. It will be a bit chaotic but once you're settled you can help other students move in which is quite possibly the best way to start making friends and making good impressions.\n\nGood luck!",

Deductibles act as a deterrent to keep the insured from filing small claims. Even though the contractor's accident caused the fire, K-State's property insurer still covers the property and K-State must pay the deductible. K-State's insurer will likely file a claim with the contractor's liability insurer to recoup money to used to pay for repairs on behalf of the university. I should note, things can change and the contractor's general liability company could step up and pay more. \n\nIt's complicated, but hope this kind of makes sense of the situation.

I hadn't taken any advanced/ap/college algebra, I just reviewed some stuff from the prep questions on their website (I think) and passed.  If it's still the same setup, you have to get 50 or higher (it's not out of 100).  It tells you your score immediately after you take it so you know when you leave if you passed or failed.  Since I didn't actually take a class in high school, there were definitely a few higher level questions I didn't know how to do.  However, these only made up maybe 20% of the questions and even if you miss those, you can still pass.  I'd recommend going through what's going to be on the test (their website I think will have minimal info, but enough for you to gauge) and if you feel like you know some of it, go for it.  Other than looking through some example questions I didn't study really at all and was fine.  It's also way easier than any standardised test or AP test.\n\nTldr; even if you never took a higher level algebra class, you'll likely still know a good chunk of it.  You don't necessarily have to know the advanced stuff since that only comes up on a chunk of the test.  ",

After about a year the police let us pick new laptops and a new xBox from the unclaimed stolen items. I ended up with a much better laptop than my original. \n\nSo my advice. Get a big ass lock for your bike. Spend the $10 a month for renters insurance. Take pictures of everything over $20 and email them to your insurance agent.

Honestly, I was kind of bummed to come here originally because my #1 school was too expensive, but I\u2019m actually super glad I came here instead of going to Cornell. \n\nAs for the campus and student life, everyone is super nice and there are a ton of concerts, movies, events, shows, etc... that come and are a ton of fun. McCain (our big auditorium) brings pretty big and famous shows every year (broadway shows like Kinky Boots, Mamma Mia, and Dirty Dancing all came, so did the Russian National Ballet and Kenny G) and students get half off ticket prices for those showsThe campus itself is pretty compact and I can easily get from the far North building to the far South one in 10-15 minutes. Because of this, however, the bussing system isn\u2019t all that great in my experience. It\u2019s nice getting to and from campus, but it won\u2019t be any use aside from that. That being said, I walk to campus so I don\u2019t know if it has improved any since last year \n\nFor food, there are 4-5 grocery stores within 5 minutes of campus. As for restaurants, the only thing super unique to Manhattan are some really good breakfast places and diners (the Chef, Early Edition, Bobs Diner). Aggieville has a lot of fun sports bars and grills, but it gets super crowded on weekends so I usually avoid it. There are some really good Asian places (Bi Bim Bop) too. The rest are your usual chains, but there\u2019s a lot of variety.\n\nAs for housing, my apartment is about 3 blocks away from campus and allows most pets. There are \u201con campus\u201d (barely off campus) apartments that have rooms specifically for grad students called the Jardine Apartments that are pretty nice and you can walk to campus in like 2 minutes. As for pets, I don\u2019t really know if Jardine allows them, but I would imagine so since they\u2019re so popular. I\u2019d be happy to answer any other questions!",

I was a actually a history major and know a little bit about the dept. \n\nFirst and foremost, I'm not sure what the research facilities are going to be like for high level research. Hale Library is great and they have some pretty unique and cool collections and archives, but you may find yourself having to make the trek to Lawrence to get to some of their collections and archives. It was all and everything I needed as an undergrad, but for PhD work, I feel I've had more opportunities elsewhere.\n\nAs far as the town, definitely see if you can visit Manhattan if you can. It's a great little college town and I think it was one of the best places I could have spent my undergrad years. Everything is compact and the city is flat enough that you can really bike everywhere. The people are also just super friendly.\n\nFinally, I don't know how many of the faculty from 06-09 are still there, but I really loved the history department. Dr. Linder was probably the best professor and teacher I had in either undergrad or graduate school. ",

I'm from Minnesota (about 8 hr drive) and haven't felt like it was too far away at all.  \n\nOne important thing to note is that about 90% of the students are in-state.  So as an out-of-state-er, it is really noticeable.  Most of the out of state students are from the Midwest  (mainly Missouri, Colorado, Nebraska, Minnesota, etc) so you'll fit in just fine.  Out of the in state students, a good chunk are from Kansas city area.  As a result, the culture is pretty similar to other Midwestern areas and most people are really nice and approachable.  There's also a good amount of students from western Kansas who are often from small rural towns.  These have been some of the nicest and down to earth people I've met.  All in all, I can guess it'll be different from your current school, but I've really enjoyed my time here and the perspectives it's given me.\n\nAs for Manhattan, it's basically by itself and not too close to any other major areas (Topeka is 45 minutes away, KC just under 2 hrs).  That said, it definitely has anything you'd need and just enough variety. ",

I'm from the Chicago 'burbs so I was pretty far from home too (but I came here after masters at University of Oklahoma so I was used to that. K-State is much friendlier IMO).\n\nThere is an airport here with direct flights to O'Hare, which may get you home a bit quicker than driving.\n\nThere is a bus route in town that's pretty new. It's called ATA bus if you want to look into it. As a grad student I lived a bit more than a mile from my departments building so I walked quite often. Much better than stressing over parking on campus!\n\nBeing a grad student here is a unique experience. I felt that a lot of Manhattan was geared toward undergrads or families. Now would be a good time to admit I'm not into sports. If you are then ignore me, plenty to do for you!\n\nIf you like going to bars, Auntie May's felt like a comfy place to hang out as a grad student. There are plenty of bars to choose from, though.\n\n\n\n",

I would find it a big pain in the ass to live in this town without a car, personally.\n\nAnd plenty of apartments allow pets (I have a dog), they just often charge $25-50 per month for pet rent and will likely have an additional deposit.

Counseling services has dedicated [LGBTQ and trans-specific] (https://www.k-state.edu/counseling/student/group.html) group therapy sessions. The LGBTQ community in Manhattan is larger than I would have ever guessed before I came out and started getting involved and on the apps\n\nOne of the happiest things for me I've seen was two guys casually holding hands in between the Engineering complex and Seaton Hall a few months ago. A grad student in my lab is also gay (came to the holiday party with his boyfriend) and at least one of my engineering students is also gay.\n\nThere are going to be ignorant people, but they're shut down fairly quickly, mostly by others in their peer groups. Realize that many rural kids without much exposure to differences come here. There were some [cowards who grafittied some anti-LGBT] (http://www.kwch.com/content/news/Slur-continues-diversity-related-vandalism-at-Kansas-State-450278103.html) stuff a while back, but the campus is definitely becoming more [LGBTQ friendly] (https://www.campuspride.org/campus-prides-2017-best-of-the-best-top-25-lgbtq-friendly-colleges-universities/), if not alreay there.",

English classes, and some economic classes, will go more into politics and personal opinions but even then most people here at KState are respecting of everyone's views that I've seen. I would say out of the vocal groups on all sides of any political affiliations, it's about 50/50, you'll hear just much from a conservative view point as you will a liberal view point walking through the union or down the street.\n\nFunny story, a couple semesters ago, just after Sanders dropped out of the democratic race, my econ professor put up a poll with who the class would vote for if the election  was that day, there was Trump and Hillary and then 2 or 3 third party candidates. A surprising amount of people, to me, voted for Trump, but that was also when conservatives and liberals alike thought he had no fighting chance of winning, so I wonder how many of those votes were joke votes?",

It's fewer classes and has a tighter focus than my undergrad which makes life a lot simpler.\n\nThe breadth of subjects covered here isn't perfect because the department is still expanding, but it is very comprehensive in several areas including security, high-level software engineering design, and high-performance computing. If you go to [this link](http://catalog.k-state.edu/content.php?filter%5B27%5D=CIS&filter%5B29%5D=&filter%5Bcourse_type%5D=-1&filter%5Bkeyword%5D=&filter%5B32%5D=1&filter%5Bcpage%5D=1&cur_cat_oid=38&expand=&navoid=6608&search_database=Filter&filter%5Bexact_match%5D=1#acalog_template_course_filter) you can see the courses we offer (graduate classes are roughly CIS 690 and above).\n\nOur professors are also very good. You can take a look [here](http://www.cs.ksu.edu/people/faculty/) if you're curious. So far for my grad classes I've had DeLoach, Prabhakar, and Munir, and I rate each of them highly. All of our professors speak English fluently, even if a few of them have somewhat thick accents. We have a strong open-door culture here and I don't know a single professor who wouldn't go out of their way to make time to help a student.\n\nThere's also student life that you should consider. The CS and ECE departments just got a brand new building which opened almost 2 years ago, so our classrooms, study areas, and equipment are all really nice, including our own CS student lounge right down the hall from our lab rooms. Everyone's friendly as hell and there are plenty of clubs and events (we have 2-3 big LAN parties every semester). And, of course, there's Aggieville, the bar district right across from campus.\n\nIf you have any more questions I'll try to answer them as best as I can. Also, where are you from and what are you wanting to study?",

For example, some of my best memories I made in Manhattan were during open house. Contrast an event like open house with this. How many students actually want to attend this? Who is this for? Seems to me this is just to make university leadership feel like they're doing something and let the identitarians prattle on about their favorite topics: diversity (of skin color) and victimhood.

Since this is a week away, it will give plenty of student organizations time to become unhappy with this whole idea and threaten to either not support it or to actively protest the event. One can joke about how a march is ableist, how a daytime march discriminated against vampirekin, or how \u201cfamily\u201d is a tool of the patriarchy, man... but just wait. I would be willing to bet that trying to figure out the details of this event is a bit like having ten bakers make a cake. \n\nI\u2019ve seen it before... in Lawrence, some high schoolers spontaneously decided to hold a rally after last year\u2019s election. As soon as it gained steam, people started picking apart the event for not being inclusive enough, for having too many non-PoC speakers, for some groups not being included in the planning. The vitriol aimed at the kids was unreal and, eventually, they gave up because it wasn\u2019t worth the stress.\n\nThis is potentially worse. If student groups protest, it will create terrible visuals and a continuing narrative that KSU is headed down a destructive path. Remember the images of the MU president being blocked and heckled at their homecoming? How did that play? Regardless of how many students attend - and my guess is most will stay away - people will point to the lack of support among non-marginalized students... the list of potential problems is almost endless with very little upside.\n\nFinally, you\u2019ve cancelled a day worth of classes that will disrupt countless schedules. Some people have Tuesday only classes. Some people commute. Some people spend their own money and expect a return for that money - what about those people?\n\n(edit to add: I hope my predictions don\u2019t come true. I hope it goes smoothly and everyone holds hands and cries together... but it won\u2019t)\n\nAll of this feels like a poorly thought out attempt to have a group hug and no one stopped to think about the risk/reward.",

A weekend of college students, especially since it\u2019s mostly freshman, can make a bathroom nasty in a hurry. My wing (boys) had some extremely gross weekends. It would often look like a tornado had gone through by Monday morning. Someone puked in a sink on a Friday evening and it sat there all weekend. Someone shit in a shower once (that was a weekday though). There is definitely going to be sex happening in the showers (always wear sandals when showering in any dorm). It\u2019s going to get nasty from drunks at some point so be prepared.\n\nMy dorm was Moore so it might not be relevant, but after opening the door there was a wall right in front of you. On the right side were four stalls and four sinks, on the left side were four sinks and four normal showers and one handicap shower/bath (not sure on the handicap one, don\u2019t think anyone ever used it). The showers had two curtains. You step in and the first area had a little bench to put your shit on and hang your towel and then you would pass the next curtain into the actual shower. The actual shower area is just a square so it was fairly small. The showers were pretty good quality though. With guys waiting for a shower was rarely ever an issue in the morning. I never had to wait more than a couple minutes. We had an old fairly crappy radio in there, which was pretty nice. Having loud music kind of help keep things more private I guess. I believe every bathroom in Moore was the same layout.",

Lastly, why is it in these articles that every single person the writer interviews confirms the writer\u2019s narrative. The narrative is that minorities feel unsafe at KSU... every person they interview confirms that. Could it be that the writer only interviews people who feel that way because I have a funny feeling that there are plenty of members of minority groups at KSU who do not feel unsafe. Just a guess.",

Just going off the article I feel that is what the \"victim\" intended given that it says the officer marked down race as white and he felt the need to say that we was black. He must have been fairly light skinned and with him being 50/50 (according to the article) that means the officer marking down white was just as true and him marking down black.  Without evidence of what actually happened we will never know. But the article talks about the incident without giving it much doubt which then creates more of a divide between students and the police department. If a student then is not able to feel comfortable contacting the police they may feel backed in a corner if a serious situation arises. Which can have deadly results. \n\nAnd I feel that they were purposefully trying to create some type of animosity between students and at least this officer.

        "body": "Actually, if you read the story closely, the second person didn\u2019t really agree. The quote was:\n\n\u201cJonathan Peuchen, speaker of the student senate and senior in mechanical engineering, was present with Kelly for the follow-up phone call from Schrag. Peuchen said Kelly\u2019s fear of harassment was \u201crational\u201d and that Kelly had spent the night of Oct. 19 in the Student Governing Association office.\u201d\n\nUnless I missed something in the story, Peuchen *does not* confirm the story but simply says Kelly\u2019s fear of harassment is rational. It\u2019s an oddly worded paragraph that a couple questions and/or an additional story could clear up:\n\n1- did Peuchen hear the second interview?\n2- what did the officer say during the second interview?\n3 - do you agree with Kelly\u2019s story as reported in the email?\n\nIt\u2019s weird that the reporter either did not ask those questions or Peuchen didn\u2019t offer a more substantive quote. Hopefully additional info will be forthcoming but... after Sukkahgate 2k17 and Carhategasm 2k17, I think critical thinking can go a long way.",

If the two participants in the photo were intentionally shaping the ponchos (which is not stated, nor on first reading of the article did it occur to me) then we have a situation that is more scandalous.\n\nHowever, to call either instance \u2018racist\u2019 is an abuse of the term.  Blackface is racist.  Slurs are racist.  This situation is not.  Humor is how people handle heavier issues.  This could even be a joke about the strange looking dressing habits of the organization, and then you have the *reverse* situation in which Klan members complain.  (Unlikely, but you get my drift.)  You don\u2019t know.  It\u2019s highly likely that these girls were not thinking of a cross burning on a lawn in the middle of the night or many other practices that the Klan has come to be identified with. \n\nBlindly calling this racism is manufactured outrage, and that is why I asked.",

Most other places don't, so expect a wait (especially at places in Aggieville).\n\nAnd FYI, the food truck mentioned in another post is only open at night.  I think it's 10:30-2 or 3 Thurs-Sat.

The campus is gorgeous but you can see that on Instagram or Google. There are two entertainment districts in Manhattan.

Downtown is more expensive, but caters more to young professionals and other adults. The mall sucks, but has a nice new theatre. If you want live entertainment, Auntie Mae's in Aggieville routinely has live bands and comedy. The university's theater department holds plays in the Purple Mask and lots of great national and international acts come through McCain auditorium. Union Program Council also holds several events each year that vary in quality but are occasionally great. There is a great art museum on campus, Mariana Kistler Beach. The region can be very conservative, but there are lots of liberals in and around the university. It's not hard to find a community.\n\nLet us know if you're looking for something specific.",

        "body": "I read through your responses and questions, I think I can be of help. I grew up in Manhattan (MHK) and went to KState before moving to Kansas City for medical school and now residency. MHK is unique in that it has a small town feel without feeling too small. It offers a great bar and food scene, passionate sporting events, natural beauty and recreation, national level entertainment and premier educational facilities. The recreation complex is massive and newly renovated, most of campus has been revamped in the last 15 years, and the library is the center point and pride of campus. \n\nFor fun there is a regional brewer in Tallgrass and new winery estate Liquid Art that are great to visit. McCain and UPC bring in music and theater from around the country and local bars host local talent. To be fair the music scene in MHK has much to be desired, but Lawrence KS is abit over an hour away on I70 and is known for their robust music scene. Even if you don't like sports you should go to a K-State football game to experience the tailgaiting and gameday atmosphere, among the best in all of college football. The Konza prairie is a beautiful hiking destination and tuttle creek and milford lake are 2 nearby lakes for water sports. \n\nTransportation is lacking like most midwest towns, no real bus or metro system, but it has regional airport that is expanding with daily flights to major hub cities. Uber and lyft have strong markets due to the young population. \n\nAs far as the culture of the town, it's clearly not the east coast, but it is nowhere close to typical small town Kansas. Granted the town and campus are not profoundly diverse as the ethnic makeup is mostly a reflection of the region, there is a sizeable international community and an overall moderate political climate. I feel that were I live now in KC is more conservative than MHK is, the city council and university are definitely more liberal than the surrounding area. It is not known to be a liberal bastion of the state like Lawrence but is certainly not a conservative stronghold (Trump beat Hillary by 800 votes out of 33k+ registered voters in the county... only 1 county in KS went blue). \n\nMHK is overall a great place to live, and routinely is ranked as a top 10 college town in America. US News and Princeton review routinely rank KSU a top school for student well-being. The town has grown fast the past 2 decades and is expected to double in size in the next 20 years due to key private and governmental contracts. I think you'll be pleasantly surprised with the little apple when you visit!\n\n",

If you're coming from a larger city and expecting all of the amenities found therein you'll be disappointed. Manhattan, is after all, a small midwest college town. Personally, I loved living there once I got over the oppressive summer heat. You're never more than 20 min away from anything. If you get a place in the right part of town, you won't need a car because a bike is more than sufficient. People are incredibly friendly (especially if you come from the east coast) which is nice. The city itself is pretty damn small,but it has one of most things that you'd want.\n\nWhat are you thinking about studying? ",

Also, they are mostly already spoken for by the returning residents so getting one as a first year resident will be a slim chance (unless they've changed it up since I was there).  They may hold one or two back for new residents.  Fun fact, the single room on Moore 5 is (or at least was) a photo lab that you could develop your own pictures in (if you had your own chemicals).\n\nI've seen residents be very outgoing in the single rooms, but I've also seen the shut-in types as well.  You'll still have the floor lobbies to hang out in if you want so you'll still have lots of social opportunities.\n\nI don't know about singles in Kramer Complex (Goodnow/Marlatt) or Strong (Putnam/Van Zile/Boyd).

        "body": "It obviously varies from person to person but I cannot recommend a traditional two-person room enough.  The floor I lived on in Marlatt had two hallways of normal two-person rooms and one hallway of suites.  The people who lived in the suites were virtual unknowns to most of the rest of us, they rarely came out and rarely socialized.  The other two hallways were constantly in and out of each others rooms.  I met some of my best friends doing exactly that.  The privacy of a suite can be appealing but you can get yourself your own room after a year or two in the dorms...a year of a roommate is worth it to make friends.\n\nEither way a few things you definitely want to do...\n\n1. Keep your door open as much as you possibly can.  The people who enjoy their time in the dorms the most are the people who keep their doors open.  The physical distance you create by shutting that 1.5\" is nothing compared to the psychological distance you create.\n1.   Treat your room as your social or chill out space...don't use it as a study space, at least not for the first semester or so.  Find yourself a place where you can separate \"work\" from \"play\" like the dorm common area or Hale Library.  This has the added benefit of being a comfortable place for other people to join you to study...jamming 3, 4, 5 people into a dorm room is bad enough, and nobody is truly comfortable studying in someone else's bedroom.\n1. Participate in dorm events.  Intramurels are great for this, even if you're not a sports type.  You can sign up to play or just ride along to cheer on your floormates.  They're free, they're easy, and you're making yourself available to others.\n1. Spend the first week just wandering the halls, especially on your floor.  Drop by the rooms where people have left their doors open.  Ask about their interests, whatever they're doing.  I met a couple of my great friends by just dropping in and listening to one of them jam on his guitar for an hour.",

        "body": "> like others have said, the single rooms are very small. Maybe 1/3-1/4 of a regular room. Think the size of a prison cell (and I'm not exaggerating by much).\n\nWeren't they originally the linen closets for each floor? That was the explanation we got the year I lived there. The rooms are super narrow, but you get 2 or 3 times the built in storage of a standard room, which makes them feel even narrower. I personally would have been very claustrophobic trying to sleep in one of them.\n\n(FYI, I remember trying to use that darkroom in Moore. I don't think it had been cleaned in years, the equipment was kind of janky, and it's a PITA to have to go down to the front desk to check out the key and turn it back in. I also remember having a heck of a time finding the chemicals, because they weren't easy to find locally and the post office doesn't like to ship at least one of them. Granted, this was all like 15 years ago...damn I feel old now.)",

It is usually a little pricier though, but if you tell then you have a Library card you can get a small discount. Also the liquor and wine selection is fairly average.\n\nI also stop at 5th Street Liquor across the street from the Post Office pretty often because it's on my way home from work and has good prices. Not the biggest selection to choose from but not bad for the size of the store.\n\nThe most consistently cheap beer in town though is hands down Classics Beer and Liquor off of Seth Childs near RCPD and Home Depot. They almost always have the lowest prices on beer and wine in town, and usually the cheapest liquor too. The beer and liquor selections is pretty average. Not a ton of craft beers, but they probably have the best wine selection in town.

        "body": "Hey! Made a throwaway for this. I know its a pretty decisive topic and I hope we can really discuss this. College is a forum for different ideas and topics to be debated and talked about so we all grow. My opinions on this are by no means final, but they are strong. As a result, since the internet is forever- I made a throwaway. Someone might eventually be able to figure out who I am but in the meantime I'd like to have some back and forth and feedback while I form my opinions. If you read all the way through this, kudos to you... I'll try to be (somewhat brief) and I will read all of your responses and try to respond thoughtfully as well.\n\n______________\n\nSome background for me so you know where I am coming from:\n\n- I am a recent graduate\n\n- Every house (not dorm, fraternity, or apartment) I lived in had a gun for self defense if necessary. It never was, thank goodness.\n\n- I am registered Republican (sorry Brownback did not vote for you though), and do consider guns a right, but not one that you can't put any type of restriction on (which technically puts me at odds with the state party) I haven't been hunting but have shot several types of guns, went to the range about a month(?) ago just shooting with a friend for fun and dropped way too much money. If you've never been you don't know how expensive it is just to shoot around...\n\n- I *have* seen what an accidental gun death can do however. Its not something that really directly affected my experiences, but full disclosure..\n\nSo here we go.\n\n_______\n\nI think as a practical matter this is an issue best left to the Universities. If they want conceal carry, allow it. But the rub is that none do. So lets break this down then. I want most University policy set by the University unless policy is deficient- then I want the state to step in. In no way did I feel like my safety was deficient and that carrying a gun would allow for me to better defend myself. As far as I could tell in every instance where students were in some kind of danger that warranted immediate and swift action the Campus and Riley police were on it immediately. Also, as far as I can tell there have not been any campus instances nationally where conceal carry helped in a similar situation, but it seems like there have been cases where it has led to negative situations. (This is where y'all present articles and facts disproving what I'm saying).\n\nLets look at what the University President, and onetime highest ranking military official in the United States of America has to say:\n\n> \"I still think it\u2019s not a good idea for campus. I\u2019d be a lot better with it if they said you had to have some sort of training, because in the military we give people weapons, but we train them on how to use those weapons.\u201d\n\nThis is partly an issue with the current concealed carry laws (another debate for another time) but it raises a good point. If you believe that guns are allowed to better protect the whole of campus then you are downright wrong. I see no way that individuals carrying will be better equipped to respond to a threat than police that are specifically trained and have protocols for such circumstances. \n\nConsider this scenario: a potential or active shooter is identified on campus. Dozens of upright, law abiding K-Staters are concealed carrying and hear about this while on campus. Before, police knew that NOBODY is allowed to carry a gun but themselves. Anyone carrying a gun could be the threat and everyone else knows this. Now, anyone carrying a gun could be a citizen attempting to contribute. And if you are one of the students trying to help, how do you know who is another legal concealed carrier and who is the shooter? If you're a student how do you know the difference? This makes things much harder and much more dangerous for the professionals tasked with carrying out our protection.\n\nThe basis for the concealed carry on campus law is not the protection of the whole-if it is that's a flawed notion- it is for the right of the individual to protect themselves. But the right to bear arms is not for individual protection. That is afforded under the right to Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of happiness. However, the right to Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness is infringed upon by individuals creating needlessly dangerous situations on campus by bringing their guns. (Alright jump on me here and tell me how I am wrong.)\n\nThe fact is, concealed carriers are on the massive, massive whole law abiding and very good people. I know a *lot* of them. Could someone bring a gun onto campus and nobody know? Yes, and it has probably happened. But this law doesn't just make something that could theoretically be done into a practicality, it has many ramifications. Do not treat it as a legalization of the status quo, whichever side you are on, because it isn't.\n\n____________\n\nTL;DR\n\nThis is best left to the professionals if you are trying to keep the populace safe. If you are concerned about individual rights, you are infringing on the rights of more people than those you are protecting.",

There's a variety of things going on. \n\nI know I'll get shit on for saying this, but PLEASE, this shouldn't even be a thing on your radar when picking a school. Honestly, seeing this question frustrated me a bit. \n\nThis university has one of the happiest student bodies/campuses in the United States. Surprising to most people, the university was ranked in the top 20 for most accepting of LGBTQ students with their wonderful club on campus (last I heard). \n\nAnd Manhattan is close to my heart. My mother grew up there, and I still have a grandmother there in town. It's one of the best towns to live in while in college. You have everything you need, it's cozy, welcoming, and you got a little bit of everything. The townies are nice, which always blew my mind because I'm sure students get annoying after a while. And the summers there are still my favorite - the population drops by about half, so all the beer in Aggieville feels like it's for you. \n\nIf I could handle small-town life long term when I'm old, I'd retire there in a heartbeat. \n\nBack to your question - it's a state school, so that should tell you enough. There's plenty to do like any other university. And I understand the social aspect is important. But it's offensive to the many many unique things about this university's social dynamic to boil it down to their parties. \n\nMy friends and I who all worked at the custom shirt shop threw awesome parties. But what I remember most about my time there weren't necessarily the parties or the tailgating for football games, but rather how incredible it was to be in Manhattan. ",

But was trying to point out how KSU is a great choice for other social reasons than just that. \n\nPeople I know like going to Manhattan on random weekends just to go out because the whole town is great. We're one of the few schools that surprises a lot of people in how great our community is, and was trying to bring that up instead of just focusing on partying. \n\nI'm not looking for anything to be mad about. I don't want them to miss out on hearing about the other things (socially) about going out in MHK that made it so great. Cause there are probly plenty of schools who would be a better place for parties. Like how at KU you can get into more bars as a minor than in Aggieville, so it's house party central for a while. I'm stereotypically gay, and while I was in school I felt so much safer than the bigger city I live in now which says a lot about the community. Weekends in MHK felt like huge parties because of that community feel that I was trying to get across. And that translates from the classroom to the bars.\n\nJust asking about parties in regards to kstate misses so many things about our school that make it great. I'm not mad. I loved partying there. Shit, sometimes on my way to the studio I'd get offered shots by people partying on their front porches. So it's not just about how good the parties are. It's about the people there. The people are what define a lot of the potential experiences you can have in college. KSU didn't feel fragmented, it legit felt like one big family. And if a tight community dynamic is what they want then this is the place. Or if they want a place where they can bounce around from group to group in a bigger pond and be a little more isolated in their social circles, then that's a little different.",

So I thought it was safer to assume they hadn't been able to hear all the other awesome parts about here that make us not only a better party school than others in Kansas (in my opinion), but just a great place to be day to day in general.

I mean check out how freakin cool [this cap](https://www.reddit.com/r/CFB/comments/4j7759/georgia_tech_student_graduates_wearing_a_cap/) that got shared on /r/cfb was.\n\nBut here's the thing, many schools that do that generally have a tradition where a large majority of students decorate caps. We don't, and as others have pointed out just a few students doing it does not look very good.\n\nGraduation is YOUR day, but you are sharing it during the ceremony with dozens to hundreds of other people.\n\nAlso, this line is very important:\n\n> the only cords that may be worn are those that pertain to scholastic honors and other K-State honors.\n\nI know at other colleges students wear decorations that are not directly affiliated with the university (many just for photos however). But at K-State there is a codified system for gowns and awards.\n\nI graduated with a master's degree. This means I had a special gown different from the regular undergrad gowns and a hood with the color of my College (your tassel will also have the color of your college- another reason for less cap clutter). There were also people at the ceremony receiving doctorate degrees. They wore even more elaborate gowns and cords in addition to a special honorary cap that is notably different and more decorated than ordinary caps. The doctorate cap is a very distinctive and special honor, and I could see how visually and ceremonially it would be lessened if everyone else had unique and obviously striking caps.\n\nMaybe you will be at an all undergrad ceremony, but the people conferring the degrees will most likely be doctors in their field and wearing full regalia. For many reasons its important to make them visually separate from the  rest of the assembled.\n\nI understand your frustration. I would have had a ball decorating my own cap. But for some very important reasons that have been in practice at Kansas State* for over a hundred years we do not decorate caps. Could that change in the future? Sure. But for now I suggest respecting the tradition or trying to create a creative discussion on the matter instead of dismissing it.\n\nAnyways, congratulations on graduating! Hail, hail hail, Alma Mater!\n\n*I put an asterisk here for a bonus fact for getting through my wall of text: your diploma will read Kansas State University of Agriculture and Applied Sciences- the actual full name of K-State.",

I'm probably biased since I grew up near Manhattan, but the people there are generally very friendly. With the university there and military near by it's a pretty neat melting pot. I'm not sure what sports you're in to, but football and basketball games were always really fun, and there are plenty of other teams at KSU to cheer on, or look in to joining.

        "body": "I'm an alumnus of the K-State College of Business.  I know you didn't ask about the quality of education (concerning) but I will address it anyhow.  The school compares favorably to other state universities.  An undergrad business degree is very curriculum based, so it's going to be very similar in about 75% of the content to the other schools you listed.  What differentiates K-State is going to be facilities, staff, and what businesses recruit out of the school.\n\nThere is a BRAND NEW business building (of which I am very jealous) that appears to be very state-of-the-art.  The staff was absolutely amazing while I was there.  Since the MIS program was only 60 students in a graduating class, we basically had one professor for all of our classes.  This made for a learning experience that was really catered to us and he had time to devote to helping us.  Many excellent businesses recruit out of K-State, including the Big 4 consulting firms, Koch Industries (politics aside, a great company to work for), and ConocoPhilips.\n\nBe sure to decide early what major you want.  Any major is fine as long as you really know what you want to be doing after school.  If you are unsure, don't do Marketing or Advertising.  General Business is better.  MIS is even better in that average pay is higher and there are ten gazillion jobs available in technology.  Finance is best in pay but is a very focused field and has fewer jobs available.  If you're doing Accounting, plan on getting your grad degree.  I believe K-State has a 5 year Masters in Accountancy program.  You should take advantage of it.  Supposedly K-State as a great Entrepreneurship program but I'm wary of that as a major for anyone.  You can probably make it through Freshman year before you really have to decide, as you'll have general business courses to take.  DO NOT TAKE THE ENTRY LEVEL FINANCE COURSE UNTIL YOU ARE REALLY, REALLY PREPARED.",

Those rumors were kicked around before the election, though. If he does get appointed Secretary of Agriculture, it might be for the best from the university's perspective.\n\nAnd as far as the lawsuits go, you can find quite a bit of information about it via Google, as various mainstream news outlets have picked it up. The Collegian also has some good pieces, including the SGA demanding that the school fulfill their legal obligations. I haven't seen any on campus protests yet, but I suspect they'll be coming. Especially since the University publicly stated just a few weeks ago that all of campus is considered a free speech zone and there are no permits required for students to protest.",

(That doesn't include 3.5 million young adults who were able to be added to their parents policies because of the change in age restrictions.)\n\nSo using the worst case scenario for both numbers, there are 4.2 more people insured than before ACA. Using the best case scenario, there are 12.8 million more insured than before. And using the most likely numbers, it's 8.6 million more insured than before.\n\nSome Republicans are claiming that millions of people lost their health insurance, but that's some heavy spin.

She says that predicting a loss is like predicting you won't get married. It's useless to predict because the future is unknown.\n3. She may believe that you \"jinxed\" the game in the same way that saying you won't get married is \"jinxing\" your potential for marriage. If you believe you won't get married, you probably won't.\n\nIt's not a good comparison; you are an active participant in your relationship status. Thinking you will never get married could become a self-fulfilling prophecy because you shy away from relationships, refuse to connect emotionally, etc. You are not an active participant in the football game. Ultimately, I highly doubt she was commenting on your marriage potential. You've misinterpreted the situation. She is saying that *you* predicting a football loss is like *you* predicting you won't get married.

In the spring game Ertz showed why he was the one qualified to be the starter, and with a developed and improved receiving core there is no reason why we can't have a shot.

Students will often go there to hang out and unwind or party like wild animals.\n\nK-State is overall a very nice university. The people are friendly, the campus is nice and compact and very pretty, and the academics are top notch. There are an incredible amounts of clubs and student organizations, so you'd be able to find one for anything from building robots to skydiving. Intramural sports are also quite popular, and there's a rec center with all sorts of equipment and courts/fields.\n\nAs for the greater Manhattan area, there's a wonderful biking trail that goes around the city if that's something you're interested in. There's also Sunset Zoo, the K-State botanical garden, several museums, and plenty of parks, lakes, and hiking trails.\n\nUnfortunately all I can tell you about the pre-med program here is that I've heard good things about it, but I'm an engineering student so I don't have much insight into that area.

Our Rec is in the top ten in the country, our students are in the top five of happiest students, and we're the 2nd fittest student body.  Those are silly things but it should give you a good idea.  Also, Intramural sports are insane.  Very competitive and there's a wide range to pick from.  Flag football and basketball to inner tube water polo to wrestling to video games.  Literally anything.  Manhattan has a lot to do as well.  And there's always people willing to do anything.  Also, it's a fair mix between conservative and liberal people so there are all kinds of backgrounds to experience and get to know.  Sorry if I'm rambling, but I'm in class and can't keep my thoughts straight.  Good luck!",

Do you want to personally be on the hook for 24/7 phone / email / chat support with next business day onsite service for the next for four years for a desktop that you build, not just for hardware issues, but software / OS issues as well? I really don't think so. We sell also sell a fairly large volume of these computers every semester; can you individually provide that level of IT support for 30+ new customers per semester? I really doubt it. If I was an architecture student, I'd be choosing to build my own workstation too because I have the technical experience (and honestly, those machines are chump change compared to a lot of the workstations and servers I've built and worked with before), but I sure wouldn't want to be on the hook for supporting other students with very limited technical knowledge.\n\nIn terms of pricing, when you factor in the cost of equivalent parts, the estimated value of that service contract, and a reasonable markup for building the computer, the prices that the computer store here on campus charge are actually pretty reasonable. Is there some markup over the parts alone? Yes, Dell has to make money, the Dell distributor has to make money, and the computer store has to make money. I can't contractually go into more details, but I can say that the prices being charged are pretty much as low as both Dell and the computer store can currently go, specifically *because* they don't want to rip off the architecture students.",

Yours is well thought out, I think we just have a difference of opinion here.\n\nI have no experience with Dell \"pro\" support, but what I do have is a ton of family members over the years who have bought Dell and had many random issues that Dell ignores, or just in general shoddy build quality. I'm not gonna say all Dells are bad, but at least for a long time the $500-$1000 range was shit. My knowledge is there, but, justified or not, I have extrapolated that opinion to all Dells, at least for my own use.\n\nI would also assume that most people who even consider building over buying have some sort of knowledge of computing. I have many friends who can fix 99% of issues with a computer, no issue, but wouldn't be comfortable building a PC. It's definitely a niche market, and I'm not trying to be an OEM here, i'm just trying to offer help to the guys who know what's what with PCs, and want to get their feet wet with one of their own.\n\nI'm also not saying buying doesn't have it's benefits, a friend of mine asked me to build them one last year, and based on her technical knowledge, I advised her that buying for the Dell service was the better choice.\n\nAll in all, you make some excellent points here, but,  for the most part, they are all points that would also come up in discussion with a prospective buyer long before a \"buy now\" button was ever clicked.",

I will also say that it's been very hard for me in the past to find a decent number of people to build computers for, because, as you said, it's a pretty niche market and you really have to make good connections to have people outside of your direct friend group be interested.\n\nWith regards to Dell, go back 5-6 years, and Dell probably deserved its bad reputation at the time, but since going back to being privately owned they've really shaped up their game IMO. In terms of quality, there's still definitely a difference in quality between Dell's consumer-oriented products and support and Dell's business/enterprise-oriented products and support. That's true for pretty much any OEM, though. And compared to the other two big enterprise vendors (HP and Lenovo), Dell's support is *way* better (anecdotally, Lenovo's next business day service has often translated for me to \"whenever you escalate the issue high enough for us to get around to sending out a tech\" service.)",

        "body": "I want to expand on what the other two posters have mentioned about studying.  I know for a fact there are some people reading this that think they can get by the way they did in high school.  And some of you might...for a few semesters.  If you're taking your gen eds first, there's a good chance a lot of you will do well without a whole lot of effort. MAKE THAT EFFORT ANYWAYS.  \n\nTake this from someone who was exactly like you and dropped out after three semesters.  When you are studying for some general basic writing class or macro econ 1, you're not studying to learn the material of that class.  You're studying to learn how to study, to learn what type of studying works best for you.  Can you effectively study in your dorm room or your bedroom at home?  Great.  What about at Hale?  Alone or in a group?  Maybe at Radina's or Bluestem Bistro.  Try them all out a few times, figure out where you can maintain your concentration best and get the most out of the time you put into the studying.\n\nI came to K-State in the fall of 2004 having had to do very little work to maintain As through most of my schooling.  I'd dropped into the B range in a few classes senior year but, for the most part, I'd skated my way through school.  I didn't know how to study.  I didn't know how to self motivate.  I didn't know how to remove distractions.  And I lasted all of a year and a half on gen eds and a few Mechanical Engineering intro classes.  It then took me 5 years working a variety of jobs to actually learn how to work, what strategies work best for me.  When I came back in 2011, I was significantly better prepared.  I now knew how to get the most out of my study time.\n\nIf you guys learn from the mistakes of people like me and put in the effort to learn how to work while you're taking your easy classes in the first year or two of college, you'll save yourself a lot of time, a lot of hassle, and a **LOT** of money.  So don't study for the sake of your early classes, study so you know how to by the time you hit the hard ones.",

For some people, they can cruise right by, but in most cases now you'll have to really study to get a good grade in whatever subject is giving you troubles. \n\nGo to class, it's okay to skip once or twice but if you know you'll get in the habit of doing it, don't. \n\nEveryone will also be new and getting used to campus, so take it as a opportunity to make friends. If you're doing dorm living, hang out with your floor. Go see free or cheap events on campus, it's another opportunity to have fun and meet new people. My personal favorites are the UPC films on the weekends and the improv shows. Being apart of something is great too and looks good on resumes, so check out extracurriculars!\n\nGo to games if you can; not just football, but volleyball, baseball, basketball, etc are all really fun and really get you hyped. \n\nThat's all I can think of for now.

Doesn't matter how well you did in high school - I can guarantee you're going to have to put in more time than you have before. Hale is awesome. The Great Room is my favorite.\n\nGet involved.  It's important to get out and join clubs and such. College is as much about forging connections and socializing as it is academics.\n\nAlso if you're going into the sciences, RESEARCH. Too many people don't know how great kstate is for undergrad research. If you're going into the natural sciences I can tell you more about this.\n\nKind of ties in with the above, but it ultimately comes down to \"seek and ye shall find.\" Kstate is huge, and that means there are a ridiculous number of opportunities out there for you to get involved and better yourself. But YOU must pursue them. \n\nThe double edged sword to being large is that ultimately kstate doesn't really care what you do, even if that means failing out. There is less of a support net than say a small school where all the faculty know your name. A little scary but also motivating. It's all up to you to succeed.\n\nLive. Your time at kstate could very well be some of the best years of your life. Find your balance between work and play that allows you to have fun while you're here. \n\nI hope all goes well! I absolutely love kstate and hope you will too. Welcome to the family.",

Go and talk to your adviser often.  They know the ins and out of this school better than anyone.  If you feel like your adviser isn't helpful or if you're not clicking, request a new adviser.  It happens all the time, nobody is going to get hurt if you switch.\n\nGo see your professors during office hours, even if you have to make up a question.  Professors will advocate for you and will support you when things get tough but only if they know you.\n\nThe University is a big, unfeeling, uncaring beast...but it is made up of thousands of people who honestly do want you to succeed.  You just have to make a bit of an effort to show them you want to succeed as well.",

Losing those two contracts completely tanked their book sales, and once textbook sales went down like that it would have been difficult to bring them back up unless they were making enough money somewhere else to make up for huge losses upfront. Even then, in-store textbook sales are currently shifting significantly towards book rentals and used books (in large part due to online competition), which are really difficult for independently owned stores to fully stock and accommodate (as opposed to the current bookstore, which can source used books, etc. from hundreds of other campus bookstores owned by Follett).\n\n> There really isn't a \"pivot\" for them to do if they were going to remain a book/ school supply store. It's not Varneys \"making a choice\" to go out of business.\n\nIt's not a choice for them at this point, but I feel like they drastically mispredicted their financial situation and outlook over the past few years, and could have made choices that would have prevented this. For instance, they could have closed their other locations and focused solely on their iconic Aggieville location. While their community engagement definitely helped maintain community good-will, that doesn't make up for declining customer service, (at least a lot of rumors about) mismanagement, and not finding ways to attract new student customers. It still wouldn't have been easy for them, but it likely wouldn't have been this catastrophic.\n\n> Varneys also has been selling apparel for a long time but they were getting the squeeze on that too- K-State has been stepping up their own selling through the K-State Superstore and especially online.\n\nAt least in terms of local businesses, K-State Superstore is run by GTM.

I've seen cars waiting for spots in the engineering lot just sit forever, hoping that someone comes out to leave.\n\nFrom what I've heard, the administration's goal is to beef up public transit, and shrink parking until there are just a few lots around, and then have people bus around between those. They just removed a parking lot to build a new residence complex, and they also pulled out some road for a \"pedestrian mall\" which so far has been largely blocked off for construction trucks.\n\nPersonally, I live right near campus, so I walk/bike everywhere and parking/traffic doesn't really affect me very much, except that people desperate for spots often park in my complex's reserved parking lot.\n\nI had an econ professor who wanted them to raise the price of parking until demand was low enough that there wasn't a scarcity of space anymore.

        "body": "Hello Boozhau!\n\nIn my humble opinion:\n\n- We may have inadequate parking, but seem have more than many other universities! (just piecing together and comparing what I have seen here to what others have said about their \"there\"s. Our lots are often full, causing would-be parkers to leave for another lot or try to \"get creative\" (often resulting in a ticket!) btw, I despise our parking service ticket writers, they are malicious and quick to make life tough for visitors, people with recently expired tags, freshmen moving in, etc.\n\n\n-The tickets could be cheaper, the passes could be cheaper, BOTH could be cheaper (especially if we cut spending. For example, we could have NOT renovated the Vanier Football complex in 2007 and instead used the $8 million to cut the price of parking passes and tickets in half for the next 300 years. :P Haha, but it could be worse.\n\n\n-Most hassle can be avoided if you show up 10 minutes before the class-rush or do something else adaptive. There are some evens like department meetings where suddenly 300 students are suddenly trying to use the lot where it kindof gets overrun...? Still, if you *really* want to drive, not walk, you can find a way to park relatively closely to most any building.\n\n\n-I think more students here should walk, however, the people who don't walk think that they shouldn't have to walk. ;) So everyone views their own ways as \"the right ways.\" What's new haha.\n\n\n-I'd like to reiterate my passionate frustration with campus parking services. I dislike them more than Isis. Its their job to leave $50 \"surprises\" for students and they take ruining peoples' days very lightly.\n\nGood luck with you Documentary!

Reserved ones are around $850\n\n> Do you find it difficult to find parking at any time?

Do you think there is a similar opinion at KSU?\n\nThis is similar to the issue we are facing. When the university needs new buildings they have to be built closer to other buildings, since students have only  10 minute travel time in between classes. The current issue has less to do with not enough parking, its more to do with not having a reliable shuttle and extensive shuttle system. It is physically impossible to have enough parking for everyone in the middle of the campus (without building huge parking garages), but if you have big satellite parking lots and a good shuttle system to connect them to the campus, the issue could be solved. This is what the university is trying to do with the master plan, but with current state budget cuts it will take a very long time to implement this.\n\nIs there anything else you'd like to add?\n\nCheck the [campus master plan](http://www.k-state.edu/facilities/projects/planning/master_plans/2025_plan/K-State%20Campus%20MP%20Report_v13_FINAL.pdf).",

        "body": "As someone who graduated last year I can say that parking at times sucked, I once arrived on campus at 8:50 a.m. to park and didn't make it to my 10:30 on time. \n\nHowever, with that said, parking for me wasn't an issue very often after I got into the groove of traffic. I would almost always get first to third row parking for my morning classes (I would arrive on campus around 8 a.m. for an 8:30 and park in Weber) and 75% of the time get the parking garage for my mid-morning classes (I'd be driving up to the garage around 9:35-9:40 for a 10:30 class). If I didn't get the garage I would park at old stadium and not even try to find a spot in the O lot, I went straight for W (At least I believe that's the correct lot, clear in the back on the left).\n\nI was able to get garage spots easily because I timed entering campus at the same time that students were leaving the garage after class, while this plan won't work every semester it did for my last two. \n\nMy only suggestion/complaint is I would have liked there to be a system indicating how full a lot or the garage is, such as, instead of the garage saying open for students have it color coated on remaining spots. (ie. green for everything down to 30 spots, yellow solid for 30-10 spots, and yellow flashing down to like 3 spots and red after that). The numbers an be changed to better fit the amount of parking and demand but it'd be nice to just have some kind of indicator on how full an area is/if there is open parking at all.",

But I can't think of any student cases thus far where they parked in the staff lot (unless it was from earlier this school year after several lots were changed without major awareness).\n\nThus far, I don't think there are many major universities with students very happy with the parking situations. \"Fun\" little situation.",

I get an hour lunch break most days, and that's still not enough time to leave campus and find parking when I get back.\n\nWe pay for our permits on a sliding scale based on salary. I'm on the low end of the pay scale, and my permit is about $200 a year. If I wanted a reserved space, or a space in the parking garage, it would cost me around $400 a year. If I got a raise, those prices would go up. They're actually going up every year anyway, but we don't get raises so our paychecks are actually shrinking.\n\nIf the campus plan is implemented like they say it's going to be, I will probably only be purchasing a parking pass for maybe another year. They keep taking away parking on campus, and are expecting us to park in the stadium lots (which are a good 2 miles away, at least) and ride a freaking bus. If our staff IDs will get us on the buses regardless of whether or not we have a parking pass, then why even buy a pass? We live outside of town (housing is too expensive in Manhattan, it's cheaper to live 20 miles away and commute) so we'll still have to park somewhere, but if we can't park within a 10-15 minute walk of where we work then what's the point of paying for parking?",

Pita Pit has amazing felafel wraps, Tasty China House (and the several other Chinese and other Asian style places) have TONS of options, there's an amazing Indian restaurant called Dancing Ganesha where all but 2 (out of 8 or 9 items) on their buffet are vegan. Really, every restaurant I've been to has had something or something really easy to get veganized. El Tapatio is one of my favorite places... amazing mexican food and many menu items that are literally just a \"no queso or sour cream, please\" away from vegan excellence. Even Dominos has happily cooperated in helping me veganize a pasta dish for delivery. \n\nThe only really tricky one is Buffalo Wild Wings where I think only the salad's vegan owing to them using animal fat to fry the fries.\n\nThe HyVee here has more and better selection of vegan specialty food than I have seen even in KC where I'm from. Tofurkey Pepperoni Pizza, Veganaise Garlic Aeoli, Field Roast frankfurthers... things I didn't know existed are all there. We also have People's Grocery Co-op that stocks a lot of other vegan specialty products.\n\nThere's the ECM house on campus that has Real Food Fridays where every Friday they serve a made-from-scratch, locally-grown (when possible) vegan buffet for a suggested donation of $2. Because of this I've met about 4 other vegans.\n\n\nI honestly was worried coming way out here in the middle of nowhere but it's actually been fine. Feel free to PM me, especially if you end up moving here and best of luck to you! :)",

Regardless of the financial aspect, though, you have to remember that Currie's been responsible for multiple PR nightmares and has yet to own up to any of them.

        "body": "Go once or twice, and see what you think. If you need ongoing treatment or counseling, though, you probably want to find an actual psychologist (or psychiatrist, depending on your needs) to see on a regular basis.\n\nMy experience with the campus counseling services was not great. I had a history of un-diagnosed depression from childhood onward, and it came to something of a head when I was a freshman here. After a 15-minute appointment with the staff psychiatrist, I was given prescriptions for antidepressants and Ambien. A couple months later, another 15-minute appointment had them upping the dosage. I met with a grad student counselor several times (Possibly weekly? I don't quite remember.) over the course of the Spring semester. This student counselor basically told me I needed to learn how to relax, but gave no instruction, advice, or tools for me to use to do so. At the end of the Spring semester, I was told that I was not eligible for any services over the summer because I was not enrolled in summer classes. I was not referred to any type of counseling outside of the university, I was simply told that I would not get counseling over the summer. Period.\n\nBy the time Fall rolled around, I had no desire to go back. My family doctor continued prescribing the antidepressants for a while before I decided to stop taking them, but I have not received any kind of counseling or therapy since I was a college freshman over 10 years ago. Things may have changed since that time, I don't know. Maybe I just got the dud grad student.\n\nI do know that I probably need to be seeing a therapist, and my experiences with the campus counseling services over a decade ago have made it that much harder for me to try to find one.\n\nI will say that if the choices are between campus counseling and not getting any help at all, then definitely go to the counseling center at least once. As negatively as I remember that place, I probably would have been a lot worse off if I hadn't gone.",

I think experiences can be mixed and if you don't click with your counselor, ask for a different one. Although I will say that no one form of therapy will make everything feel better, reaching out for help is always a good step. \n\nOne thing I found particularly helpful about counseling services was that they're able to work with the office of student life. I hit a rough patch and really just needed to take a few days off (which included a test) and they worked with my professors so that it didn't hurt my grades.\n\nIf you're struggling, seek help. ",

Revived the energy of the crowd and made us known for at least a year or two as one of the toughest places to play. \n\nFlashforward to this year: 16-17 record, no post-season, and suppressing school spirit among other things. To top it off we could have hired a former K-State grad, Brad Underwood, who has had incredible success in his first couple years of being head coach, also used to be the associate head coach under Frank Martin, but he was snatched up by OSU instead. He is considered to be a grand slam hire, and to add more to the pile he wanted to coach here but our AD was more worried about padding his resume with safe hires instead of smart ones. ",

You will inevitably be living with a few or more guys you aren't a fan of but you'll also make a bunch of great friends from all over. \n\nMy only advice would just be attend rush events at different fraternities and you might find one you like.

What I can say from an office stand point is that majority of the Fraternities (and all of the Sororities) have chapter wide GPAs above the all campus average, a trend that has been consistent for over a decade now. \n\nMy suggestion would be to check out Greek Experience - a day long seminar for graduating high school seniors to check out their options in Greek Life here. \n\nhttp://www.k-state.edu/fsl/greek_experience/\n\nThere are a number of excellent options in housing, both wet and dry. I do know of a few organizations that have events with other Residence halls so that you may feel connected to those students as well.\n\nFeel free to pm me if you have any other questions, or would like to schedule a visit at Greek Experience or a 1 on 1 visit with one of the undergraduate students.\n\n-Kyle",

I also looked at several houses before picking the one I did and I am glad I didn't rush (get the pun) right into it.\n\nMost of the fraternities have houses. Some are wet and some are dry, but the enforcement of those rules and atmosphere is different at each one.\n\nYou will not be an outcast from the dorm people. The people here are nice and won't be a problem, and if you catch flak for being in a frat then they probably wouldn't be good to hang around anyways. If anything you'll be more popular with the dorm people as they look for a place to go party.\n\nI would recommend getting in contact with the recruitment chairs of different fraternities and checking them out. Rush for fraternities is Informal as opposed to the sororities so you can get a feel for the guys in the house. Remember, join the house for the guys in it, not the letter on the front of it. What you hear at one college is vastly different rom the reality at another I have found. \n\nIt sounds like you won't have much time to feel out a fraternity if you don't come up a bit early (which I recommend, I don't think you would regret taking a the trip). There is some time at the beginning before pledge cards are due but don't rush into a house just to do it. Some offer spring rush, and there is always next year. If you know it's right than definitely do it but I've seen guys end up in just about every house that didn't fit right and didn't like the experience.\n\nAs for the priority on schoolwork, every house will be different to an extent but it will really boil down to *you*. I've seen kids party too hard in the dorms and drop out, and 4.0s in hard majors in fraternities.\n\nThere are a lot of good fraternities at K-State, I am sure you will do just fine.

        "body": "First of all; sorry to hear that you have become discouraged. Hang in there! I had my undergrad advisor suggest that I change out of engineering entirely after my first semester (2.4GPA). I used this as motivation to work harder. My final GPA wasn't stellar (3.3), but I had been involved in other things (Aero Design, etc) that gave me great, marketable, skills. Also, it gets easier as time goes on. The workload is tough, but the classes become more interesting (thermo, fluids, etc). If you understand the material well enough to get a B in Calc 3, you will be able to use that knowledge in future classes. I didn't fair well in the math courses (C in Calc 2, B in Calc 3), but my grades got better as time went on.\n\nIt sounds like your advisor doesn't understand the point of her job, or was busy/having a bad day. It isn't just about following the flowchart, it is about being supportive when students take initiative to talk about their concerns (kudos, BTW).\n\nHave you talked with other Profs (Wanklyn, Beck?), or someone in the main office about changing? I would try to talk to someone in person rather than emailing them at first. If nothing else, seek out another professor that you know to take on some of the advising role.\n\nYou're welcome to PM me if you want any other advice. Best of Luck!\n\n",

For anyone who isn't familiar about how to properly lock a bike, the two most important fundamental points are:\n\n(a) Don't rely on cable locks as a primary method of securing bikes. Cheaper cable locks (the most common ones around campus) can be cut in a few seconds with household wire cutters, and a cheap pair of bolt cutters from Walmart can easily cut the rest. If you care about your bike, spend the $30-40ish to get a basic u-lock from an actual security company.\n\n(b) Properly locking your bike with a u-lock is really easy. The simplest way to lock your bike for a lower theft risk area like MHK is to lock the rear wheel to a rack through the frame's rear triangle, as in http://www.sheldonbrown.com/images/locktechnique1.jpg, or to lock both the rear wheel and frame to a rack.",

(Definitely considered trespassing, but I did it loads of times and apparently so have other people since there's a trail. 10/10) \n\nKind of a weird one, but the international market on Fort Riley Blvd is definitely worth checking out. They have awesome food from all over the world and some pretty wild produce as well. \n\nTop of the world is an awesome place to go at night or day to see a different side of the town!\n\nFor those of you that enjoy going to coffee shops, but hate how many people are there on weekends, check out the Radinas on Claflin near Seth Child. It's never as packed as the ones in Aggieville.\n\nThe Chef is obviously the best place in town for breakfast, but if you find yourself waiting for over an hour, check out HyVee's breakfast. It's actually really nice and good and SUPER cheap. I mean SUPER cheap. Not to mention it's not very crowded and there's never a wait.

I worked for KSU as a student, so hopefully I can help a bit. \n\nI assume you're asking about a job as a Student Worker (i.e. a student working for K-State).  I can't say how hard it is to get a job as a student worker- I knew the guys I would end up working with so I was basically handed a job.  If you know someone on the inside it helps immensely. That being said, the application process is the same with any job. I don't know about getting one through job fairs or CES as I didn't have to go that route. \n\nAs far as pay, you're gonna make minimum no matter where you work, as far as I know.  You have to be enrolled in a minimum of 6 credit hours to be eligible to be a student worker.  The maximum hours you can work during a semester is 30, and during the summer is 40.  \n\nJob to avoid? Parking Control Officer (PCO). They're the people that look for parking infractions and give people tickets.  Avoid this job unless you want to be hated by the rest of campus. ",

I just finished my undergrad at KSU and was a student worker for 3 years.\n\nCampus jobs rock, most of the people I know who worked on campus were always overall pretty happy with it. Hours at KSU seem to be a lot more flexible than hours with a non-campus job (other than food service workers mainly). Also, you have the opportunity to get a job that's relevant to what you're studying. I worked as a research assistant and that *really* helped me get internships and my current job.\n\nYou can apply through CES; that's how I found mine. If you want help on your resume or interviewing skills, they offer great free advice. Knowing someone on the inside does help, but it's totally possible to get a job even if you don't. The dining halls are pretty much always hiring.\n\nAs far as I know, everyone starts at minimum wage. I've heard rumors of people starting at higher than that and it is possible if you're an upperclassmen with previous relevant work experience. However I received regular raises (based off of a time scale and performance) which most of my friends with campus jobs also experienced.\n\nOverall, I would definitely recommend a campus job if you can find one. Except PCO because everyone will hate you. \n\nBut welcome to the fam! I really enjoyed my undergrad years, you'll have a great time. EMAW!",

For eating down there I would recommend Kites, Rock-A-Belly, Taco Lucha, or So Long Saloon. Notable dive bars would be Auntie Maes, Aggie Lounge (The Lou), or O\u2019Malley\u2019s.\n\nIf your looking for a slightly older crowd, then downtown on Poyntz is another great pre-game destination.  For food I\u2019d recommend Tallgrass Tap House, Bourbon & Baker, AJ Pizza, or El Patron.  For a great pint of local beer try  Manhattan Brewing Co.",

Klieman seems to do well in the transfer portal so he could find good replacements.  The recruiting has picked up so there should be some depth that hasn't been there in a while, with players ready to step forward.\n\nThere is continuity in the coordinator positions, so that bodes well.  If Howard can take another step forward, QB should be one of the best in the conference.  We all know that QB play makes or breaks a team (looking at you Mahomes).  \n\nSpeaking of the conference, we're going to be playing some brand new teams next year, so scouting by the staff will be paramount.  They could always lose a game they shouldn't because of newness of the schemes that create unexpected mismatches.",

I don't think Ward is of the same level as Vaughn but it shouldn't be a crazy drop off. From what I understand Duke will be going back to DE this year and we all remember how good he was before getting injured and Felix having his break out party. Knowles was always so so for me. If Keagan Johnson is what I have heard I believe he will be better than Knowles.   \n\n\nIf Howard continues to improve I agree he may be the best QB in the conference. Having the whole offensive line returning will be huge for this offense. We still have Deuce Green and Austin Moore returning at LB. Will Lee and VJ Payne at DB, Savage and Clifton at Safety, and Matlock, Mott, and this Mississippi State transfer on the D Line. Like I said in my original post my expectations are high.",

The other reason is it would allow Bill to say F U put my son in charge or I'm staying. There may be some pressure put on him to retire, but they know they can't fire him unless a Joe Paterno type situation happens.    \n   \n   \nWhat I think needs to happen is we need to hire someone from outside the program and send Sean somewhere else. He has spent his entire career playing or working for his Dad. He needs to go work for someone else for a couple years and be exposed to new things. Then get some head coaching experience somewhere else for a bit. Then he can come back if things work out that way. Though really Sean should have done all that years ago. I think the school and the fan base would be a lot more comfortable with him if we had seen him have some success when he wasn't working in his dads shadow. ",

        "body": "my $.02:\n\n1 - This feels like Weis 2.0. I can't think of a single time when a school has hired a coach who has been out of coaching after being fired from a \"big name\" school and then dropped down to a lower, struggling school and had it work out.  \n\n2 - His deal with LSU just before being hired shows me he is all about the $$$.  He got LSU to pay him $1.5m so they could save $5m over the length of his buyout.  Now look at his contract - $2.7m base jumps to over $3m as long as he sticks around...FOR TWO SEASONS! So here is his math - \"I can keep collecting $1.5m a year or 6 years from LSU.....or.....I can get $1.5m from LSU PLUS $6.2m ($3.1m a year) from KU if I work two years.\"  Oh and if they fire him, he will get another $8.1m.  Look, Les will be 66 before he coaches a single KU game.  He just managed to convert a modest $1.5m a year income into a minimum of $15.8m from just two years of work.  He basically doubled his income and with the usual perks like car, plane, phone, etc his cost of living also plummeted.  \n\n3 - KU is once again in a SERIOUS hole with scholarships because of Beaty hitting the JUCOs hard the last two years.  Add to that the new transfer rules and this years recruiting class likely being a total bust and Miles is going to have a very rough first two years.  In fact, when you look at that in light of his contract, its almost like he figured this was only a two year gig.  I would not be shocked if a significant number of Beaty guys left if they have a redshirt available.  \n\n4 - KU still has abysmal facilities and abysmal fans.  A couple of recent player interviews have really highlighted the lack of fan support weighing on them.  And of course now that basketball has started, what remains of the football season is being completely ignored.  They will play their final game tomorrow in front of a hand full of fans, half of them wearing burt orange while more \"fans\" travel to Brooklyn to watch the squeaky shoe cheaters.  This ties into the redshirt thing above.  You have an opportunity to transfer and have 1 or 2 good seasons of football or you can stay and play in front of no one while hoping the new coach doesnt put \"his guys\" ahead of you on the 2 deep. Yeah, watch the transfer wire.\n\n5 - AD stupidity left Beaty and his guys for the remainder of the season.  This told the assistants they were NOT being considered in any way.  That means for the last month they have been out shopping for jobs as much as they have been coaching.  At the same time, Miles is coming of the beach.  He doesnt have a ready built staff.  There is almost zero chance he gets a complete staff ready to go prior to signing day unless he scrapes every fired coaching staff in the country.  No smart, on the way up, assistant is coming to KU so that means he is going to get the guys who are moving down....usually for a reason.  \n\nNope, Im not worried.  KU is tossing more good money down the drain and I love it.  ",

The OL can't block.  We have only one P5-quality WR.  The RBs aren't terribly fast, although Barnes does well when the OL creates a hole.  We still have no identity on offense because our playcalling is completely bi-polar.\n\nAll of these things point to a failure of coaching and recruiting.

To his point of being the old guy in the press conference at 51, I am a bit stunned I have such a different perspective of Snyder from that being put out there on social media I've seen.  I've watched Snyder intently since about 1996.  (mikegundyvoice) I'm a man.  I'm 40. (/mikegundyvoice).  \n\nThe typical social media crowd apparently have a huge challenge understanding Snyder's words.  I don't view his words, I view his actions.  Anyone who reads Snyder literally on matters like this doesn't understand the man.  This IS a somewhat typical Snyder QB battle.  What has changed is the w/l record while it's happening and an expanding opinion in the fanbase it's time for Snyder to go.\n\nFor the record, I believe it is past time...by 3-5 years. That doesn't color ME on this issue though. Bill is in a tough position here.  It's obvious to me that Skylar CAN be the best passing QB to ever play for Snyder.  Certainly, he is the best passer I have ever seen at K-State when you see the glimpses of what he can do. Those are few and far between.  He should be better.  So should Alex.  Mr. Delton can be every bit the QB Jonathan Beasley was...and perhaps he will be and be just as picked on by the fanbase.  The problem both face is the severe hollowing out of overall and game-changing talent within the program.  Alex is there to push Skylar and vice versa.  Seemingly, neither of them have gotten better this season...you can make the argument is a small sample size Delton has gotten worse.\n\nGetting back to \\*the question\\*, I can see how the initial question was disrespectful to Snyder.  Kurtz claims it was a QB question.  Well, it was a Skylar Thompson question...and he is a QB.  The response he got should have indicated he wasn't going to get more out it revisiting it later...but he did.  There was a response, which is somehow noteworthy to everyone and a sign it's Snyder's time to go.\n\nNot to me.  I liked the fight!  That's the Snyder I remember.  Not Snyder 2.0. It shows me the fight that built the program and MAY still be there.  I still have my doubts though...way to many.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https://soundcloud.com/powercatdigital/the-powercat-podcast-100318](https://soundcloud.com/powercatdigital/the-powercat-podcast-100318)",

Yes, he was able to get a couple first downs, but the momentum shifted when Delton threw the INT. The Bulldogs would score a few plays later. There was NO reason to pull Skyler and put in Delton, who has consistently made poor decisions in the passing game. If he\u2019s coming in for some type of Wildcat package, fine. He should not be dropping back to pass. \n\nSkyler\u2019s 23-yard touchdown pass was no fluke. That\u2019s his game IMO. Think about last year\u2019s Okie State game. Skyler also had a pass early in the Miss St. game (maybe his first throw) that was a perfectly placed ball way downfield into double coverage. WR just couldn\u2019t pull it down. He\u2019s also just as quick as Delton. Maybe not in open field but certainly running between defenses. \n\nThe O line isn\u2019t doing any favors for either QB, but I think definitively naming a starter will help the whole offense play better together. \n\nI was at the game, so I\u2019m sure there are elements I wasn\u2019t able to pick up on from my seat. \n\nLove that we have this sub now.

We gave up plays, but above all we were sound and didn't break, specifically Duke Shelley came to play and showed a lot of hustle.\n\n2. Our offense has glaring issues.  No clear QB, but one of them is very much the better option (Skylar Thompson) lets keep him in during pressure and slumps and see what he can do when under pressure and when his back is against the wall. He's a decent runner and can actually throw, unlike what Delton currently is right now. \n\n3. We need to have better play calling. We are too predictable, we had better play calls than last week but i think we need to be consistently having some trick up our sleeve type of plays.",

Truth is, however, those guys have been few and far between in Snyder 2.0.  Normally in a game like this a big special teams or turnover score leads to the win.  Even if that would have happened here, it wouldn't have been nearly enough.\n\nNeither Thompson or Delton have shown anything to be THE guy.  Skylar's arm, of course, isn't helped by the lack of quality receivers.  I was totally good with saying goodbye to Corey \"Bill Snyder is a slave master\" Sutton, but it's tough to watch him being the play maker at App State.  Even Dom Heath had a TD for App State this past weekend.\n\nIn the end I expect this to be another mediocre season.  Didn't we all expect more when all of the sophomores and freshman starting showing up on the two deep at the start of 2016?  No real play makers ever developed.  Seemingly, the potential is there with Skylar, Barnes, Zuber etc..  Reality is, we all are still waiting.",

If you were to change the outcome of a handful of key plays, the score would be tied.\n\n\nI know you could say that about every game, but this one particularly looked promising. It's not like they were just dominated by a more physical opponent. The offense could move the ball at will up until about the MSU 30, and the defense kept them pretty contained except for the big plays.\n\n\nI'm pretty optimistic about Big 12 play. If the team plays exactly like they did here, it will finish in the top half of the conference. If they figure out the QB situation and improve in passing, they may even knock off one or two of the top teams.",

Delton and Thompson both played poorly and looked out of form. Zuber looked like the best player on the field and sparked the team, can he ride that momentum?\n\n- Better play-calling, we need to be less predictable, I\u2019m fine with an in your face run game but that and QB runs are what we are known for. We are going to get smoked against MSU if we don\u2019t Change the formula even a tiny bit. We don\u2019t need a total rehaul of the offense, but we need some spark and something new.\n\n- Shelley needs to improve. I have always expected Shelley to blow up. But year after year he has still proven to be a defensive liability in my eyes with not a lot of upside, can he be the powerhouse in the secondary that I thought him to be when he first started playing for us? \n\n",

I dont think any of the people saying that have any real concept of how we were before Snyder.\n\nYes, but what we have is mediocrity.  Granted, it's a high level of mediocrity as expectations were created by Bill Snyder and that fed into a generation of  Wildcat fans.  That mediocrity is that the programs is floating between 6-9 wins a season.  10 win seasons are half a decade ago.  This has not happened with Snyder except during the initial building of the program.  This brand of mediocrity IS better than what K-State was before the 90s.  It's also better than the latter part of the Prince era...at least we the Wildcats are competitive.  It doesn't match the expectations created by the entitlement Snyder created though...and that's the disappointment a generation of fans feel.\n\nThis says nothing about the revolution of K-State athletics and the facilities overall.  Wow, different discussion...but go back and watch some early 90s football games and admire how far the stadium has come!  I seriously doubt ANY power 5 team could sell conference homes games in this era.  Now, probably truth is that they don't need to due to the conference profit sharing...but imagine K-State getting kicked out of the Big 8.\n\nI can exist in both the opinion that Bill Snyder has done great things to lift up a program from great depths and University on the brink AND that it might be best to have him retire if K-State can find the right replacement.  At the same time, I may be unique in being able to be able to remember a lot of the early years.  \n\nThe intent of the post is not to get into any of these arguments though (should Snyder go, who should replace him etc.).  More, it's to point out the depths which K-State came from, the constant underestimation from the media, and to remember the road Wildcat fans have traveled in the past 25 years.  The path was rarely obvious, and that's part of what made it so fun.    ",

Skylar will be thrust into the action, throwing for 5 TDs with 495 yards on a 5/5 passing line. Then he will be horrifically decapitated by a 4* defensive lineman from a school down south. We somehow beat a top fifteen school 45-30 with nothing but an eclectic group of walk ons and the 6th string WR (white, 6-2 180 pounds) running the Wildcat at QB. 7-5. Snyder retirement rumours abound. We talk about it all fucking offseason. Snyder retires a quarter into the 2019 season, forcing Sean to take over as the interim. Sean appears cloaked in a dark miasma. We attempt to offer Leavitt or Venables the position. They both decline, and somehow both end up as Clemson head coach. Sean takes us to 6-6 permanently.",
