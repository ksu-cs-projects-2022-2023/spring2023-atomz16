There\u2019s also a state park, Ledges, that\u2019s absolutely gorgeous (not sure about how it will be in April when you come and visit but its a nice thing to keep in mind)\n\nSafety on campus- I haven\u2019t personally experienced anything that I have felt unsafe in. I have walked numerous times when it\u2019s been dark out, even by myself a few times. (I just heavily recommended staying in a group when going out and don\u2019t leave a single person behind) \n\nParking - I don\u2019t have a car up here currently and so I can\u2019t entirely comment on this. I do have friends that do and it\u2019s nice but other than that, CyRide takes you over to target and everywhere you need really. It\u2019s common for students to take it to get over there. Other than that it depends on where you live but in the Friley area its free on the weekends but gets heavily congested by Friday evening/Saturday morning. If you do end up by stadium, theres buses that run over by there so it\u2019s not too terrible.",

I would suggest that pretty much what you\u2019re looking for is 16GB or more of RAM, I recommend a decent graphics processing unit (GPU) but does not need to be top of the line. You\u2019ll want an SSD - maybe 500gb. And I recommend going with 6 or 7 core processor minimum. (I am also not a huge computer person so there\u2019s a lot of things that could be wrong with what I just said). A lot of my peers use a dell Inspiron, but really any windows laptop that has those 3 things and you\u2019ll be okay. I will say that for Aerospace, the high computing and processing is done in either the computer lab or it is thrown on to the HPC (high processing computer) which is a giant computer in Howe (the aerospace building) and students have access to it.

It sounds like this person has more of an issue with crowds.\n\nAlso, most of the men there are not judging you or trying to make you feel uncomfortable or unwanted.  Most are there to work out, enjoy their time there and be done.\n\nThese \u201cissues\u201d seem more like internal problems you have to deal with rather than something others have to do.  Simply put, this sounds like a you problem.  Obviously everyone should make people feel respected and welcome at the gym but there is only so much that can be done.",

You can get tutors for most subjects at a very affordable price, and some classes have Supplemental Instruction which is free!

During the fall, it\u2019s literally breathtaking. Walking to class is super easy and short usually, if it\u2019s across the entirety of campus it\u2019s usually a 15min walk. The dorms can be iffy, I recommend choosing a roomate you know and choosing a dorm that has AC. Dorms are never gonna be as nice as you expect but the convenience of being close to campus and your friends makes it easy to forget about. Professors are dependent on which major you\u2019re going into. Idk what you mean by hospitality, but there\u2019s often dining halls nearby where you can use your dining plan for, Friley and MWL both have dining halls inside the dormitory. Everyone here is really nice, just be respectful. I\u2019d rate it a 8/10, docking 2 points because a lot of the culture around here is very party based and Greek life based.

But there are plenty of great professors at ISU.\n\n\\- Are the dorms nice?  \nI suggest you live in a dorm in your first year. After that, you can move into university apartments (were called Fredriksen Court when I was there) or you can rent an apartment with friends. There are plenty of apartments near campus or a but ride away (bus is free)\n\n\\- Is there hospitality?  \nIt's a small town. So everyone is nice and willing to help.

Would you recommend it to others applying as well?  \nISU is a great college, you'll make tons of friends since it's a small town, especially if you eat in the dining hall in your first year. Unless you're looking for a big town, you shouldn't hesitate. Of course you should also check how strong the academic program you're interested in is at ISU.",

I worked there a few years ago, but when I did they allowed a semester of accommodations before documentation was a must. From my recollection, they also had accommodations active for your entire time at ISU if you submitted documentation, and you had the choice to activate it for each class. I don't remember much outside of class accommodations, but I know they also work with res halls and other settings where accommodations would be helpful to implement. They just can't help too much with grad school labs research under PIs.\n\nReally, you can't go wrong with doing that first appointment to see what they can offer. Though know that a doctor's note could always help your case.\n\nEdit: I also want to note that they can't apply accommodations retroactively. So if you wish you could have had accommodations later in the semester after missing classes or something, can't do much. I always suggest going and then having the option to use them.",

They sing happy birthday and you get a small ice cream dessert (really good ice cream concoctions btw). It's a BBQ restaurant, but think more comfort-y food. Texas Roadhouse is more of a steak house, but really low key. They sing happy birthday to you and sometimes bring out a rocking horse to ride on while they sing. Fuji is a Japanese hibachi w/quality sushi. They sing happy birthday to you in their own special way. They usually give you a tambourine and make you dance while they sing. El Azteca has two locations. One in the SE part of town and one in the north. They are a Mexican joint. I think the one in the north is a little nicer, but they are both good. They give you a sombrero to wear while they sing. They usually give you a small fried ice cream. You will get a good moderately priced meal at all of these restaurants. \n\nThose are the places that celebrate birthdays that I'm aware of. There are quite a few good places to eat in Ames that don't specifically celebrate birthdays as well. The one recommendation that I will always give is that if you're still partying by breakfast time (or are up by that time) find The Grove Cafe on Main St. They're a greasy spoon kinda place that serves probably the best breakfast in town. Always get 2 pancakes to share w/your meal. Hope you two have a great time!",

The overall college enrollment rate has increased since 2000.\u201d\n\nSo your first assumption that higher education isn\u2019t very diverse is already wrong. It can definitely be less diverse in some states or some schools, but diversity exists in college for the simple fact that college is pushed on so many students now. \n\nAside from that, college isn\u2019t just a place to take an idea to debate. You aren\u2019t just allowed to debate issues that the country as a whole has already solved or moved past. White supreme oats don\u2019t get an audience to debate in front of; big surprise right? Far right conservatives don\u2019t just get to make their rounds and spew hate either, why, because it causes a rift and violence in due time. There is a reason debates are not tolerated at certain times, because arguing for the sake of arguing doesn\u2019t mean anything.",

They all have elevators and are air-conditioned.

My experience with calc at iowa state though is that you need to have a very strong understanding of algebra. Calculus isn't really calculus, it's more like algebra with a bit of calc spice at the end usually. So if you feel strong with that I think math 165 would be ok. The only pre calc concept that really carries over much was knowing what the angles are on the unit circle. For example pi is 180 degrees, root 2 over 2 is 45 degrees, that sort of stuff.

        "body": "Hi I\u2019m just now seeing this post I though the Math 267 final was also pretty challenging but not relatively hard to finish in 4 hours. Some of those 10 questions like the eigenvalues/eigenvectors, half life, stability/phase diagram or just the simple ODE\u2019s we\u2019re fairly easy. I think I skipped problem 2 at first because my brain just left my head when I saw that problem and instead of wasting time I moved on and was able to figure it out afterwards when I had left over time. Laplace transforms were challenging for me because I still wasn\u2019t that comfortable with solving them and how to rearrange it to make it make sense lol. So I took most my time there. However for the series I was always good at understanding series and the Laplace transform of series was pretty straight forward so although challenging as question 9 and 10 I finished those up at a moderate time. Overall I finished the whole exam with about 30 to 40 minutes to spare where I went over my work. Surprisingly got 100/100 even tho I though I did a couple of them wrong but that was just me doubting myself. I had Man Basnet and he really taught that class well and nothing that was on the exam was too surprising because I believe he prepared us well. Passed Math 267 with a A and will go down in history as my favorite Math class besides Calc 2.",

So nothing really unique in Ames in particular that\u2019s different than any other small collegetown. Other than the specifically ISU related activities mentioned below like intramurals and Dance Marathon, the City of Ames has a cute, small Main Street, parks, libraries, etc where you can go to venture into town. The City of Des Moines and Iowa City are within driving distance. People often go to Jordan Creek Mall in West Des Moines, the state Capitol building, Iowa City, Okoboji, Sailorville Lake, the Iowa State Fair, or to Minneapolis, Kansas City, or Chicago on breaks. But these are usually things people do if they have a car, if you\u2019re on a field trip with a club or a learning community, or once they are upperclassmen with friends who have cars. \n\nOverall there are some great restaurants to try in Ames and some amazing plays that come to town in Stephens Auditorium. But like, it\u2019s a college town at the end of the day - it\u2019s not going to be downtown Chicago. Sports are a big part of what people do on weekends - tailgating for football games, standing in line for basketball tickets, etc.",

I made friends with my neighbors within a week, but it takes some effort to get to know people. With the showers, since people have irregular and completely different schedules, people shower at different times of the morning/night. There were four showers in the bathroom closest to my room and five in the bathroom a ways down the hall. I rarely ever saw it full but I had some 8ams and I showered sometimes in the afternoon because of my busy schedule. The limiting factor for shower times was the time the janitor cleaned the bathroom. The cleaning time is different for the two bathrooms on the floor and it just depends on the janitor\u2019s schedule. They lock it off for an hour and you can\u2019t use it for that hour, but you can use the other one. That\u2019s usually when the showers would be congested in the only bathroom open. The nice thing with the showers at Geoffroy is that they have individual floor to ceiling doors that lock with a space for you to change and then there is the shower with a curtain.\nEach floor has a den that has some tables and chairs and possibly a couch. That\u2019s where people on the floor hang out and study, but people also hang out together in their rooms. Doesn\u2019t really matter where.",

I think the only reason I was able to get hired with an MIS degree was because of two pretty solid internships. If you go this route I would recommend getting your foot in the door somewhere for a first year internship and then the second one will come a bit easier.\n\nI currently work for a fortune 150 company and some of the smartest coworkers I have were also ISU MIS grads. Having said that we put MIS majors at the bottom of the list for internships because the perception is they won't have the same technical knowledge as a Com Sci or engineering major. \n\nAs far as the program I would say it depends what you want to do for a career. MIS will lack some of the technical knowledge but you'll learn business process techniques better suited for business analyst or quality assurance roles. ",

We also tend to learn a wide variety of pieces that are generally more challenging than in some of the other choirs. The Singers rehearse every week day, and there are often weekend trips to sing that add a considerable amount of time commitment with being in the Singers.\n\nThe ISU Singers have a great national reputation are a little known gem of ISU, and its totally worth it!",

You can take a five week class in Oviedo, Spain.  The class is totally in English and taught in partnership with UW Madison.  I did this in 2016 and loved it.

Talking to people from other Chem E programs I think our labs are above average in terms of reliability.  \n\n>Summer internships?\n\nYeah, sophomore summer you might be able to get something but freshman summer you pretty much have to know someone.  Honestly after you take transport 1 (356) then you can do pretty much anything on co op / internship.   Lots of people size pumps and do basic mass balances.  GPA 3 - 3.5 should be adequate. \n Junior summer is when you really need to have something or you will have a harder time getting a job after you graduate.  \n\nIf you want to be productive over your first few summers you can try to do research with a professor.  If you look up when their group meetings are then you can start going, maybe try to read a few papers and ***be persistent*** and eventually you'll get in.  Try talking face to face with profs, go to their office hours with questions about research, and you will stand out.",

I'm not sure if it's because they came here for research and were forced to teach. Or maybe if they're just so deeply educated in their majors that explaining \"simpler\" courses is harder for them to break down. Or maybe it's the larger class sizes and people aren't very engaged. I don't know.  \nI also can't stand the professors who try to blame their students for their own inability to teach properly.

This is seemingly happening with a route from Chicago to the Quad Cities and it could extend to Iowa City and Des Moines later, but a north/south route doesn't seem likely anytime soon sadly.\n\nThe biggest obstacles are probably our state government and freight rail issues which affect passenger service across the US.

CyRide is gold route which is free for non-students as well. Overall a great value for having an apartment as a college student. My experiences with the laundromat have all been positive. I almost always leave it unattended and have never had a problem. In-unit laundry would be preferred, but it\u2019s only 75 cents per load and there are plenty of machines available. I use my toaster oven pretty frequently since it\u2019s quicker than the stove and it uses electricity, which is included in the rent. It is a gas stove and you do have to pay for your monthly gas use. It is a small kitchen, but you get used to it and it\u2019s still very functional.",

(I live around 150s I can taste the pipes \ud83d\ude05) there is a cutting board right above some drawers, but I recommend to just get your own. Also clean before you put anything away, as the drawers when I moved in were nasty. Contact paper works on counters to spruce it up a bit and only leaves a bit of glue residue that can be washed off with soap.\n\nLaundry is fine, but there can be piles of clothes just sitting there on the folding stations. I typically sit for my washing to be done and leave when it's in the dryer. Weekends are always busy, but you can plan for a weekday instead or go really early/late in the day.

It largely depends on what sort of thing you are interested in though. I don't have any experience with ABE 325, IE 305 or CON E 380, but I would say if any of those sound interesting, go ahead and try them out! Also one pro strat is to sign up for more classes than you actually need, and then a few weeks into the semester, you drop the ones you don't want. Can be difficult to fit in your schedule though.

I took MatE 273 and the first exam is mostly on bonding which was kinda a freebie for ChEs, second was toughest about steel phase diagrams and properties, final was on Ceramics and Polymers with ceramics just requiring memorization and polymers being kinda easy for ChEs. Only other grades from my memory were the lecture quizzes. Quizzes were about 1 per lecture, but they wouldn\u2019t be due until exam time so you would be able to go at your own pace (or cram the week of the exam). IE 305 I\u2019ve heard is very useful and at least when I had registered for it Helwig was still teaching it this semester (conflict with another class and dropped). Helwig is a great professor according to rate my professor and all my friends in IE.",

Some are automatic consideration by the office of admissions, they have some for international students.

She joined a sorority and lives in the house.  \n\nIf you live any distance away, buy bigger things online but ship to the stores in Ames or Ankeny.  We bought her microwave and mini fridge that way so I didn\u2019t have to carry it several states when driving.  There\u2019s a parent Facebook group where you can ask questions.

Our D is design so we waited until she was accepted into her major after freshman core to purchase her laptop.  Also some majors the tuition increases once they get accepted into the major so be aware of that.  Best of luck.",

I think a lot of the complaints levied against it are moreso problems shared by both physics 1 and 2, but they're problems nonetheless.\n\n\nProblems on the HW, at least in my experience, are way harder than the problems on quizzes and exams. For whatever reason, physics has two kinds of quizzes (the in-person ones you take at recitation, and weekly online \"checkpoints\"). Lectures can very much go either way, but if you have certain profs, all they're going to be is a research prof saying equations at you and expecting you to absorb them. If you haven't taken calc 3 or diff eq, certain units may be harder than others. \n\n\nOverall, I don't necessarily regret taking it here (although I still have to take the final, so that could change) - my grade isn't stellar, but I'm not at risk of failing the class (again, final pending). If you can afford to take it somewhere else, I don't think it's a bad idea, but if you don't struggle with electricity and magnetism and you're good at reading equation sheets, you'll probably come out well enough that you don't need to retake it",

Idk what kind of person you are, but I need to have as few barriers between me and my work as possible, and just having the desktop always ready to go is great for my productivity.",

You can certainly bring a desktop if you'd like but it's not necessary.\n\nI'm in mechanical so I don't know if any CAD is in your curriculum but as an engineering major there might be. So you may want to consider having something with good enough specs to run CAD software, but if you don't it's no sweat, you can just use one of the many computer labs on campus",

The heavy-duty software that we need to use at a junior- and senior-level won't run well on a laptop unless I'm willing to shell out the money for a gaming laptop, which is kind of a scam (speaking as an enthusiast nerd). I personally find that it's really important to have a laptop for taking notes on campus and a desktop for the CAD software at home. By the time I was using that software, I was living off-campus and had space for a desktop, so it wasn't as important for me to be able to run it on my laptop.\n\nI value easy iMessage communication with group chats for clubs and group projects.

Derek chauvin would not have been prosecuted unless riots had occured. It's bullshit, but that's how it's been.",

I get what you're saying from a pragmatic sense \"this is the reality\" but generally you should not advocate for MORE violence.\n\n\"Yea but MLK had lesser known race riots\"\n\n\"I'm not saying censor ideas but pull a Germany (censor ideas - even Nazism)\"\n\nIf a Nazi speaks what are the odds someone will seriously  agree?? Their argument that Jews are lesser people but yet also somehow in charge of the world is illogical. So I don't think they'll have a great time recruiting anyone who wasn't already hateful and just wanted a reason. So again the BEST answer is to have dialogue (point out the illogical statement) or ignore them.\n\nIn this video and old man yelling in the wind gets punched -  woo hoo.

There may be shorter 1-3 minute stretches of downtime at time points if the buses and roads are empty)\n* Why are the buses always late/early?

It feels like 99% of students are afraid to show their personality, or talk to the teacher casually. Since I started doing this in my last year (graduated December 22\u2019) it changed everything. 1) it made me popular among my piers, ppl from other semesters coming up to me in class saying they remember me, random people in your classes going out of their way to stop talk in the hallway or bars because they knew I was nice, etc 2) teachers LOVE this, students all act like brick walls to them generally. when one person starts talking a lot, sharing new ideas, asking questions, and importantly making jokes, it wears off on the other students and they start to open up more and let their guard down.

A job through the university, like at one of the teaching farms, will be FICA and Medicaid exempt for students taking more than 6 credit hours (if I remember correctly), over time gets 1.5 hourly pay as well\n3. CLUBS! That\u2019s one of the best ways to get in contact with new people with similar interests. Also a great resume builder and source of volunteer hours! I highly recommend Students Helping Rescue Animals!\n4. The Mexican food truck that\u2019s often outside Kildee Hall has great food for pretty reasonable prices if you need something quick between classes!\n5. TopHat will be a regular occurrence for a lot of classes. Just get the longest subscription so you don\u2019t have to worry about buying it multiple times (made that mistake)\n6. Watch out for skateboarders or those one wheel electric boards. Cars will slow down for you, they will not.\n7. Trust Rate My Professor when signing up for classes.\n8. Don\u2019t worry about taking as many classes as you can. I was taking 18 credits for the first year and last semester, and I burned out big time. Remember, 12 credits is considered full time!\n9. Save some easier gen-Ed\u2019s and spread them throughout harder classes. An easy class can help keep your GPA up if you have some hard classes that you don\u2019t do too well in",

But it's the things that stood out to me :)\n\n* **Short on Money?** Looking into Iowa's SNAP program (Food assistance) The requirements could be different than now but I was enrolled in my junior and senior year when I worked part time. I worked 20 or so hours and was able to buy more and healthy food which helped immensely!  [https://hhs.iowa.gov/food-assistance/SNAP](https://hhs.iowa.gov/food-assistance/SNAP)\n* **My biggest regret is that I didn't** **study abroad** in my later college years. I love traveling abroad now, but spending several months actually living somewhere is something else. My now husband studied abroad in England back in 2012, and just this past year we traveled back to London and met his British friends he still keeps in touch with! The world is bigger than Iowa.\n* **Spending the summers at ISU was one of my highlights in my years when I lived in apartments**. I had friends that stuck around because of internships, summer classes, or home was many states away. it was too much work to find a sublet. So we stayed the summers and it was a blast! The town get quieter and slows down compared to the school year...but there's still people to hang out with. Also way less traffic. The weather is nice and the campus is gorgeous.\n* Less people around in summer + warmer weather = **Great time for the curtiss to Beardshear run. Just saying.**\n* **Ledges State Park and High Trestle Trail bridge** are nice areas nearby to get out and explore outside Ames. Also nice date spots.\n* Have a good balance of everything. Schoolwork is important, your health is important (mentally and physically), and being social is also important. Leave some time to party.\n* I didn't bring a car freshman year. I brought a car when I moved off campus. But very useful if you have a job where the cyride doesn't really go. I worked in hickory park catering for a summer and I had to get people to drop me off at home sometimes because the cyride didn't run late enough.",

We can't forcibly make the yellers stop because they have first amendment protections.  They most closely mirror the pharisees or the false prophets from the scripture. They claim to be of faith and yet grace seems to be the last thing they want to talk about, and they are eager to condemn and demand perfection following condemnation, which is essentially the opposite of Christian theology, which is grace first, and the will to repent being the natural response to faith.  \n\nMy understanding is that yelling at nonbelievers to stop sinning is a fools errand.  It also alienates them, which is opposite to the mission of the church, so no born again Christian would partake in such behavior.\n\nAs for your statement in the first paragraph, I'm not sure we're treating the word represent the same, so that would create a disconnect in the discussion that I'm not particularly sure how to address, and so I think that particular topic of discussion has come to a dead end",

No, it does not.  But real Christians are well aware of this.

Personally my \"fun classes\" are thermo, mechanics of materials, and circuits and motors this semester. They are challenging but like I said quite fun. \n\nA quick rundown of what we are doing currently...\n\nThermo: analysis of different systems from turbines, compressors, diffusers, and nozzles and calculating work, temperatures at the input and output, efficiency of these systems. Next chapter is on power plant stuff so that should be cool. \n\nMechanics of materials: This class is basiclly \"if I put this load on a material or object what happens?\" Currently we are looking at where stress will be largest in an object (beams, pressure vessels, etc.) \n\nCircuits and motors: Honestly I don't know how the EE majors do it. This stuff is hard. Once you do a bunch of problems though it starts to make sense. Motors is definitely much more enjoyable and interesting. Right now we are looking at generators and steper motors. \n\nThe engineering 101 class was required for me and like most required classes... A complete waste of time. Just go and get through it. It did briefly talk about the other engineering majors however do not expect to get any in depth description or information about them. For that you will need to talk to one of the advisors or better yet someone in the program. \n\nLmk if you are curious about anything else",

        "body": "This past week or two in junior year aerospace classes have been roughly like this:\n\n* AerE 331 forgot-the-name-but-basically-Controls-2: Learned how to sketch two useful graphs (rlocus and Bode) that show information about control systems (still don't conceptually understand it because it takes place in the s domain and that is still kind of magic for me). Previously we would plug this into Matlab but doing it by hand has helped my understanding a little bit.\n* AerE 362 also-forgot-the-name-but-its-about-optimization: Learned a few more methods used to optimize functions/designs, in particular quadratic penalties (instead of directly cutting off a constraint, it severely penalizes it without introducing discontinuities and makes the math nicer). Also did some basic stuff with Matlab's built in neural network functions two weeks back.\n* AerE 361, aka programming is pain: Translated my C code from a few weeks ago into Python code. Tasks included writing to and reading from a file, a hangman game, creating various very specific functions, and coming 2 inches away from murdering whoever programmed the autograder.\n* AerE 361 group project portion: Fought with the Arduino IDE to get it to recognize the microcontroller, and instead of making the game I got distracted and started making a piano instead.\n* AerE 311 Aerodynamics II: Electric Boogaloo: Stuff with converging-diverging nozzles (rocket engines lite). 2-3 weeks ago the principle that makes it work finally clicked for me on a molecular level and I love those moments where everything suddenly makes sense!\n* AerE Propulsion Laboratory: Got to watch a supersonic wind tunnel do its thing through a converging-diverging nozzle. Unfortunately it looks less cool than it sounds, but it is the fastest thing I've ever been within a few feet of!\n* Make To Innovate: Began using GNU radio to attempt to decode signals from our under-construction microsatellite after all other methods failed. Learned about software defined radio, and accidentally got the ADCS (the thing that points the satellite) working again by staring at it aggressively.",

        "body": "MechE:\n\nME 421: System Dynamics and Controls:\nBasically a ton of putting circuits, servomotors, heat transfer, fluid dynamics, and dynamics problems into the Laplace domain. Lots of determining how to connect courses we\u2019ve taken both to each other and to transfer functions, which we can use to prove stability for systems. MEs focus a lot more on getting the system representations correct, AeroE and EE take similar classes but focus more on PIDs and implementing controls, but also don\u2019t go as far in-depth into the system dynamics realm of control theory. \n\nME 370 - Instrumentation: Weird combo of circuits, signal frequency, a little mechanics, first-order, Fourier series, analysis of those topics.\n\nME 373X - Science and Practice of Brewing:\nA really cool, unique, interesting course about everything about the science behind brewing beer. Taught by 3 knowledgeable, experienced, dedicated professors, in the nations biggest and best university beer lab. Mostly biology and chemistry, not a lot of mechanical engineering.\n\nME 415 - Capstone:\nThis is a senior level design course, basically a company comes to ISU with a problem they want engineering students to solve. You\u2019re given a group of students and a budget, and the semester to solve it. Because ISU doesn\u2019t get to pick the projects, the difficulty can vary a lot. Some other groups in my class are solving some extremely difficult, theoretical problems that even a group of experienced, full-time engineers wouldn\u2019t be able to do. Some other groups might get less difficult ones.\n\nEDIT:\nI came is as undecided engineering. The 101 class was pretty helpful at that point, but admittedly Mechanical Engineering is very different than how someone can describe it to you as a freshman when you are only taking math and physics classes and haven\u2019t touched any true engineering. Every class is basically just differential equations (\u2026not fun) and calculus (kinda fun) applied to some niche field of physics. A lot of my friends are AerE, and the two majors are nearly identical for over half of the degree. AerE focuses more on fluids in the last few semesters and, well, airplanes, whereas MechE focuses more electrical stuff (circuits, motors/generators, instrumentation)  and thermo stuff (thermodynamics, heat transfer, etc.)",

Last semester was the design phase, and in late February/early March we started building the aircraft. Our flight readiness review is this week and (weather allowing) we begin test flights this week or next week. I had previously taken Make to Innovate so it felt a lot like doing that again, though my project was also working with aircraft. \n\nAER E 411: Propulsion, basically Aerodynamics III. Focuses a lot more on aircraft engines. Right now we're going over using stoichiometry for fuel and also turbine efficiency. The course has been a bit rough (especially the recent exam), but not awful.\n\nAER E 452/I E 452: Systems Engineering and Analysis. Probably the most chill class I've been in. No exams, only a couple of case studies and assignments. Right now we've been going over lean six sigma which is commonly used in businesses and optimizing systems.\n\nASTRO 346: Astrophysics, which counts as a technical elective for Aerospace and M E (also taking it to finish out my Astronomy minor). Focuses on the physics of stars, stellar atmosphere, birth, evolution, and death of stars, supernovae, black holes, etc. The professor is very chill despite the intimidating course material, though you definitely need a decent grasp of physics. Side note, ASTRO 344L is another technical elective option for AER E, M E, and E E. It's an interesting, relatively chill class where you get to use a telescope to get imaging of stars, galaxies, and other stellar objects. You get to even do a project of your own choosing, as long as it's doable with the telescopes. If you're interested in space and want to play with a telescope for credit, I highly recommend it.",

I drove my friends to and from Des Moines a lot and as an out of state student it was the only way I could get home without having to rely on someone dropping me off at the airport and many of my in state friends had to catch rides with people back to their hometowns or have their parents pick them up. \nI also wouldn\u2019t be able to have the research job I do now if I didn\u2019t have my car freshman year because the bus didn\u2019t run to the location. Having a car on campus is definitely a luxury but if you plan to be very active running around ames/Des Moines and not just campus then it could be very worth having that freedom. \nI don\u2019t know what residence hall you\u2019ll be at but many of them have some sort of parking available on the weekends or after 5:30 on weekdays so it could be worth it.",

The class is easier over the summer because the syllabus is a little chopped down and you have less projects. Important topics are understanding the implementation of the newly introduced data structures like Linked Lists, Heaps, Binary Trees and Graphs etc, I would highly advice to get your concepts from 227 cleared up as the first half of the class is based on those concepts.\nBatinov has slides and code for every lecture and if you go through them throughly then you should be good. Overall it\u2019s a very important class and probably one the easiest.\nGood luck!",

I've always had a good understanding of arrays when I took SE 185 and 227 so learning new ways of storing information is something I immediately grasp.\n\nThe projects in 228 are in my opinion easier since you can apply a lot of the same code from lectures into the assignments, just make sure you have a good understanding on how the things taught in lecture work and you should be able to finish the homework projects in 2-3 days. All homework assignments are the same amount of points and you can get up to 10% extra credit depending on how early you submit them.\n\nThe only thing 'difficult' in 228 are the exams because you actually have no idea whats going to be on them so you **NEED** to have a good understanding on everything you learn. On exams, you will be asked to write code for algorithms or certain methods of data structures. I cannot memorize code, so I have to understand how the data structure works and then I write the code based on the behavior. You also get 20% of a question if you write \"I don't know\" and you can get 5 extra points for having neat handwriting.",

A diverse and robust education means exploring these social complexities in a structured learning environment to familiarize students with the historical, societal, and political contributions of diverse populations. \n\nThrough completion of the U.S. Diversity requirement, students will achieve at least three of the following learning outcomes:\n\n1. Identify the experiences and contributions of underrepresented or marginalized groups and how they have shaped the history and culture of the United States.\n\n2. Understand the analytical concepts of culture, ethnicity, race, gender, sexuality and/or religion and be able to apply these concepts to an analysis of the United States.\n\n3. Analyze systemic oppression and personal prejudice and their impact on marginalized communities and the broader U.S. society.\n\n4.

The impact of knowing even a little bit of ASL and having the desire to interact with Deaf and HoH people in a way that respects them can be profound.  #4.\n\nWhile I am a hearing person, I researched Deaf culture for awhile when I was considering med school for audiology. I\u2019ve never taken a language course at ISU, but I doubt they never cover any culture or history of the language that is taught.\n\nIf the ASL courses do not pass the diversity criteria, then the department may find it impactful to have a \u201cDeaf Culture, History, and Future\u201d type course to fit the criteria.\n\n(also, Disability in a Diverse Society, SP ED 210X is listed as U.S. Diversity, which does not focus on a race, ethnicity, or gender group but how disability interacts with all of them, similar to how anyone of any ethnicity can be Deaf \ud83d\ude42)",

Whether people share accounts with their roommates for other devices is probably very dependent on their relationship with their roommates.\n\nIn my opinion, for things like Netflix, there's very little harm to throwing in a \"guest\" profile or something to share with people.",

There are a few big data classes like CprE 414 that would likely be relevant. Some of these classes are under CprE since software systems is a CprE focus area.\n\nWe do have basic parallel computing taught in our OS courses: CprE308/ComS352, which is in the core curriculum.\n\nI don't see UIUC or UMichigan requiring a parallel algorithms course or anything beyond a systems programming course.\n\nI'm sure there's a better way to complain to the university than through reddit.

They just kinda seemed removed even though they were between everything, probs oh just kept to themselves\n\nTo break down:\n\nFar west: friley, Helser, Eaton and Martin. Friley is it\u2019s own unit and Helser is it\u2019s younger brother. Eaton and Martin are apart of the group but people are generally richer over there \n\nMiddle: oak elm linden roberts Lyon, etc are sort of an eclectic group of smaller dorms that swear by the dining hall in the basement of oak elm lol (it wasn\u2019t that good)\n\nEast: maple willow larch, great compact dorm towers over a great dining hall.

In terms of the dorm itself, it's definitely the nicest dorm but also one of if not the most expensive to live in.

Speed was focused on students that were going into engineering, while Apex was more general. I was part of speed and both groups were housed on the same floor, so I got to meet some peps from the Apex group. \nAnyways, besides the fact that it\u2019s free and you can gain up to 8 credits in the summer! You\u2019ll learn about resources available and how to get around the campus. Trust me, it\u2019s way easier to get around and learn where everything is at when there are only a couple hundred people on campus, than when you arrive the first week of school along with +30K students! \nYou\u2019ll meet people that will become your support system through your next four years and some will become your friends for life. \nDon\u2019t know the current stats, but from my generation almost everyone graduated! \nI can share my entire experience, but do you have more specific questions?",

Now, I can't tell you whether or not he would have had the same experience if he never went to ISU for his undergrad and just went to GWU the entire time, but I can say that he has articulated frustrations with GWU's campus and the people present as a new student. I'm not gonna say that ISU's community is better than GWU, but I will say that you ought to figure out what kind of collegiate experience you are looking for and choose based on that.

In today\u2019s day and age, everyone should know how to code at least a little. Especially as a mechanical engineer, the number of computers and software programs that interface with machines is always growing and it\u2019ll help you learn how to adapt to that.",

It's extremely useful to know how to code in the job market to automate tasks and the like. Another benefit is exposure to a different field and industry. I'm considering doing statistics and data science for my masters degree even tho I have an ME undergrad because I found out I really like those two things.\nCon: it adds a lot of load onto your schedule. For me, 227 wasn't that bad but I took 228 and 230 together which was a lot of work. 311 is a contender for the hardest class I've taken only up there with thermo 2 and heat transfer. It is incredibly hard to wrap your mind around the concepts and such. \n\nOverall, I'd say make sure you're actually interested in advanced topics and not just coding. If you just want to code learn that on your own, but if you want to learn about data structures, algs, and whatever your tech elective is (I took 474-machine learning) then go for the minor. Just make sure you can balance everything.",

There's also free food, some items (t shirt I think?), and an opportunity to get to know the campus and speak with your DIS team leader who has already been at ISU for at least one year. \n\nOn the other side, the last day is usually less interesting, imo. Since greek life rush is that week, lots of people will also skip DIS to spend time with the people in their frat/sorority. So if you're planning on joining a frat or sorority, it might be a good idea to spend a day or two at DIS and the rest of your time with your greek community. \n\nPerhaps the best thing to do is go to DIS on the first day and check the vibe.

The subject of MIS 340 was supposed to be on \u201cProject Management.\u201d \n\n* Scheduled class time was wasted with the professor constantly storytelling, often without regard to relevance. (Yes, attendance was mandatory.) \n* The objective for the semester project was unclear at first, but I eventually found out that all our group needed to do was piss around with a Jira board and hack together a presentation on it. \n* The professor provided question banks to study for exams, turning them into nothing more than hoop-jumps.\n\nWhile MIS 340 was my most disappointing class, after almost a year of experience in the workforce post-graduation, I can acknowledge how little I learned from the MIS curriculum alone. Most of the MIS classes were simply too generic to teach any useful skills. For example, as far as I was aware, there were no MIS classes on configuring Microsoft Azure AD and Endpoint, administration of Oracle NetSuite, or simply educating less computer-savvy employees and helping them put out fires, just to name a few of my biggest responsibilities today. \n\nEven if there were classes on those subjects, I wouldn\u2019t have known if I needed to take them. MIS is an extremely broad major that can take you many different directions, so the generic content of the classes is not completely unjustifiable. However, as it pertains to my current job, I honestly think I learned a lot more useful skills through my cybersecurity minor, my on-campus job at one of the departmental IT helpdesks, and personal interest in various subjects. \n\nFor these reasons, time-wasting aside, I don\u2019t place blame entirely on the professor or the MIS curriculum. Your university experience is what you make of it. The more you learn now, the better off you will be in your future profession.",

The big thing to remember is that it's generally debris during tornados that cause fatalities and not getting sucked up into the air like you see on the movie Twister.",

They're active on Twitter at [@NWSDesMoines](https://twitter.com/NWSDesMoines) and Facebook as [NWSDesMoines](https://www.facebook.com/NWSDesMoines).  Yeah, I know both of those are old people socials, but their social media policy is probably older than most of their meteorologists.\n\n* [Here's the NWS local forecast page for campus](https://forecast.weather.gov/MapClick.php?lat=42.034660400000064&lon=-93.60693489999994#.ZCRYg4TMIwF).\n\n* And [here's the NWS Des Moines home page](https://www.weather.gov/dmx/).  Whenever there's a severe weather outlook, their most recent set of briefing slides will be linked from the top ~~left~~ __right__ - look for the yellow box with the hazard-triangle symbol and the words \"click to view briefing.\"\n\n* There are a bunch of free or low-cost phone apps for monitoring radar, forecasts, and weather alerts.  My preferred one on my personal phone is Clime (formerly NOAA Weather Radar).\n\n* Our campus weather sensor package is on top of Jack Trice Stadium's press box.  You can find current conditions and historical data at http://story.weatherstem.com/iowastate.\n\nI expect some of our meteorology majors will be along shortly with other recommendations.",

Their intent is to provide outdoor warning for people in parks or on the street.\n\nMost weather apps will have an option for an audible alert when a tornado warning is issued.  The National Weather Service should also push a Wireless Emergency Alert (WEA) over the cell network, so make sure that's enabled in your phone (on iOS, it's in Settings > Notifications, then scroll all the way down to Government Alerts).  It'll be *quite* audible even if your phone is silenced.\n\nYou may also want to consider a NOAA weather radio, which is a radio receiver specifically designed to activate when NWS sends an alert.  They're about $40 at retail, probably a little cheaper on Amazon.  My caveat here is that radio reception kind of sucks in heavier-constructed buildings.  They're great for use in houses, not so much in many of our classroom and office buildings on campus.",

Friley also is at a very good location. It is close to stuff on campus, is right next to the best bus stop, it's right next to the nicest gym, and has 2 dining halls. Towers and maple willow larch are too far from everything so they aren't very good choices. Make sure to get a dorm with ac if you can afford it because it makes a big difference.",

Bathrooms (at least mine) are fully updated with more privacy than just a shower curtain lol.\n\n No AC for most of the rooms, and the radiator is kinda annoying to run right, but it's really not that big of a deal if you have a fan and a blanket. There's no dining hall in the building, but Convos and the MU are both a pretty short walk. Also lots of buses stop by the dorms so even though it looks out of the way, it really hasn't been bad. They don't feel as old as they are in my opinion.\n\nHaven't stayed anywhere else so idk what else is out there, but I really like it.",

I live there right now and in my experience they are the nicest but not social at all. I do get a lot of work done there, and over all it\u2019s a pretty chill environment. Last year I was in Helser. There is no AC, small rooms, and a shared bathroom. The community was amazing though. We all hung out in the den after classes, went out together, watched stupid movies, had a den fish, and competed with each-other on our den Wii. Because of Helser I have a plethora of amazing memories I will never forget. If you are at least a semi extroverted person, you won\u2019t have a problem making friends in Helser at the beginning of the year. Everyone freshman year is looking for friends and the den is the only place with AC in Helser. This is why so many friendships are made there. Also Helser is cheapest dorm on campus.",

        "body": "I live in Martin Hall, which is suite style, so I share a bathroom with four other people, and we have a shared living room as well. \n\nPros:\n\n\u2022 the bathroom- I hate communal showers because they\u2019re a little gross and often uncomfy, plus I like having control over how and when my bathroom is cleaned, and leaving stuff in there saves on storage space\n\n\u2022 the living room- it\u2019s not too big but we fit a couch, a TV, a fridge, a microwave and a coffee make comfortably, it\u2019s nice to have a private living space seperate but still connected to my room \n\n\u2022 the kitchenettes- in Martin every floor has two kitchenettes with ovens and often times there will be a microwave and a toaster. This is nice for when I want to cook or bake \n\n\u2022 the dens- each floor also has one shared living room with a tv in it which is nice, and gives a lot more opportunity to make friends, and connect with others \n\n\u2022 the study rooms- every floor also has four study rooms so I don\u2019t have to leave to go study at the library if I need to study late at night \n\n\u2022 social- my floor at least, is very social, I\u2019ve met some of my best friends and I have met soooo many people. There\u2019s always events happening around campus, but I feel like every week there\u2019s been an event to go to in Martin, which makes living there super fun \n\n\u2022 right next to state gym\n\n\u2022 right next to a parking lot\n\n\u2022 AC\n\n\u2022 tall ceilings\n\n\u2022 close to classes (especially for engineering) \n\nCons: \n\n\u2022 Expensive- Martin is one of the most expensive places to live that is not apartment style. I personally think it\u2019s worth it, but if you don\u2019t mind communal showers, and you don\u2019t care about a living room, then I\u2019d say it\u2019s not worth it.\n \n\u2022 Other costs- having your own bathroom means buying your own toilet paper, paper towels, soap, hand towels, cleaning supplies, plunger, bath mat, shower storage, anything you can think of really, which can be pretty expensive, but thankfully the cost should be split among four people so it\u2019s not too bad. \n\n\u2022 small - because so much is fit into a small space, it can be a little cramped, the rooms are smaller than most dorm rooms, and the showers are a little small, especially if you\u2019re tall, you may have to bend down to use the shower. \n\n\n\nIf you\u2019re thinking about living at Martin, the corner suites are much bigger and the lofted suites are huge, if you\u2019re willing to spend the extra money to get one, I\u2019d do it. They also come furnished which is really nice. \n\nPersonally I love Martin, but it all depends on your preferences and price point, and if you find you don\u2019t like where you\u2019re living for whatever reason m, you can always switch dorms.",

(Especially as a design or engineering student).\n\n-Close af to dining centers for both eating and working for ISU dining. (Two right next door). \n\n-The remodel of it from 2019 makes the interior look welcoming and more expensive than it is compared to other dorms on campus for the same price.\n\n-Community is very friendly and I haven\u2019t had any issues regarding my learning community outside of the occasional noise, but everyone is very friendly even if you don\u2019t communicate as often.\n\n-Dens are pretty neat and aren\u2019t depressive compared to other dorms. (When my friends bought me to Oak and Elm their dens looked like abandoned ghost towns).\n\n-Singles are easy af to get even when signing up for a double. Around 5 people on my floor no longer have any roommates or never had any move in.\n\n-RAs have always been nice, including front desk.\n\n-There is an elevator and a new laundry room is being made that is right next to it for better convenience.\n\n-Bathrooms are spacious as hell.\n\n-There is a kitchenette on the first floor.\n\n-No bats, bugs, nor mice infestations so far. (Looking at you Friley and Buchanan).\n\n**Cons:**\n\n-There is no AC, unbearable in the first month but pretty easy to live with. Heating is available though and a godsend in winter. \n\n-There are mold in the showers, or at least hopefully something else. (Like the handle)\n\n-Meal plan is required for living here unlike at the towers or in Linden.\n\n-Rooms themselves are small af compared to other dorms I\u2019ve seen. Corner rooms may be better though.\n\n-Not as many places to explore or hang out in, such as compared to Friley. There\u2019s less options for study areas here.\n\n-No promised Mall of America trip in my learning community like told online rip.\n\n-Fire alarms, but thankfully this year has been minimal compared to poor Friley.\n\n-Friley (at least Meeker) has a better community and opportunities to socialize. There\u2019s more interaction between RAs and residents in these areas too.\n\n-This is exclusive to my floor, this semester had a lot more guys invited and saw some attempt/allowed in the women\u2019s bathroom. Usually late at night and it\u2019s sketchy.",

You also miss some classes in CS that help you understand how computers work that is also helpful for cyber, but not crucial. If you go into  any of the three above majors you also have the option of more security electives. Additionally you have the option in computer engineering to master in security. I think if you want to do anything in security or relating to security your best bet would be the majors listed.

Complex variables was just calculus with imaginary numbers which was fun but I also think it depends on the professor. Analysis was rough and it\u2019s a rigorous approach to calculus. Partial differential equations is a tough time as well. Intro to probability and statistics was the most boring class to me but that is because I\u2019m not a big fan of the subject area.

All i know is they invented the digital computer at ISU and the CS program is highly regarded. I\u2019ll give you some insight into ISU/Ames as a whole that may aid you in your decision, but as others have said, either school would be fine and a degree from either would be attractive to prospective employers. Im in a different field obviously, but what I have found is many employers are more concerned with relevant experience than where your degree came from. Someone with a community college degree, but has a few years of relevant experience is often ranked higher than someone with a degree from a top university with no/very little actual job experience. If you can find a part-time job while you\u2019re in school that is in your field, that gives you a head start out of college in the job experience part of your resum\u00e9 and will likely get you hired quicker than your classmates who didn\u2019t work in college or worked in a different field than their degree. \n\nThe cost of living in Ames is wayyyyyy cheaper than Chicago, so your money would go much farther here. Campus is pedestrian-based here so you dont need a car. Cyride busses will take you just about anywhere in town you need to go and riding them is free as long as you can present your student ID. If you dont have a student ID I think its just a couple bucks per ride. There\u2019s an app that shows where the busses are and the time till their next stops and routes that makes it all super easy. \n\nISU has great career fairs to make connections and companies from all over the state come to recruit students. There may not be anywhere near the amount of job opportunities actually in ames as in chicago, but if you find a remote job, it is a great place to stay after college and eventually raise a family, or you can move somewhere else for work after graduating. Just 30 minutes south of here is the biggest job-hub in the state (Des Moines and its suburbs). There\u2019s quite a few job positions on-campus as well if you need to work while in school and they\u2019re more likely to be able to accommodate your class schedule than off-campus jobs and they tend to pay better than the mom and pop small businesses. Many fast food places and Walmart/Target/Hyvee are also *somewhat* accommodating to students. There\u2019s also lots of factory/warehouse jobs on the edges of town that pay quite a bit more and most dont require any education or prior training, but you\u2019d probably need a car or a ride from someone to go that route as i dont know if cyride goes all the way out to some of them. \n\nOverall Ames is a great place to live, you got pretty much anything you\u2019d need in terms of shopping and food and it only takes about 15 min to get from one side of town to the other. We get a lot of international students so ISU is really good about helping students who have moved from far away get settled in and if you end up w a local roommate or neighbor they\u2019ll gladly show you around town and show you all the interesting stuff to do. \n\nEither way you choose to go, best of luck in college!",

Not sure if you're from IL suburbs, but another thing to keep in mind is you may end up having lots of friends who commute from home at DePaul, which is a big cost saver, but also makes it a bit harder to make friends.   \n\nDePaul has less research activity, so if you want to go into academia ISU might be the better choice, but I don't think you'll be getting an education that is significantly better or worse at either.  \n\n I would guess they would have fewer companies that may come to their career fairs (?) Than ISU,  but you would have access to networking events across Chicago to make up for that.  \n\n In general IMO career-wise the school you go to doesn't matter much for CS (for industry at least), people will tell you it does but the specific US news rankings of your school mean hardly anything to recruiters in CS (unless maybe top 5-10 school, but even then it matters much less than other fields).  So I would ignore rankings in that respect personally and look at what environment you'd rather be in deep down, cost, logistics, etc.",

That said, I'm still looking for at least 10-20 more since our attrition rate usually rises during the summertime, and we will be implementing additional \"extra bus\" shifts in the Fall to help with high-volume loads. If you've ever been interested in the position and will be around during the summer for training, *now* is the time to apply. We can get you trained during the summer and you'll be set for the Fall.\n\nOur starting wage is $20.14/hr with annual Cost of Living increases.  My estimated calculation puts the wage on July 1 $20.80/hr. \n\nWhat we're looking for in candidates is a good attitude and a friendly demeanor with customer service skills. No large vehicle driving experience is necessary and we will teach you how to drive the bus and get your CDL. Right now, candidates with weekday availability are being prioritized as we have very few nights and weekends shifts available. Most morning shifts are from around 7:00am-11:00am and most afternoon shifts are anywhere from 2:00pm-7:00pm.\n\n(Also, since this is an official statement and I'm acting in CyRide capacity, I have to include that \"Ames Transit Agency D.B.A CyRide is an Equal Opportunity Employer. Position is subject to drug and alcohol testing.\")\n\nIf anyone has any questions, feel free to let me know!",

Another cool place is a DIY venue called The A Hole. They host a lot of local bands but also draw in talent from other states too.\n\nAs for Des Moines, one of my favorite places was Vaudeville Mews but that sadly closed down in 2020 (RIP). If a small venue is your vibe though xBk Live in the Drake neighborhood is pretty good. Wooly's is pretty popular and has good shows often. Horizon Events Center (FKA Seven Flags Event Center) is solid as well - the likes of Beach House and Cage the Elephant have played there. As for specific events, 80/35 happens in the summer but the lineups haven't been as good in recent years IMO but it's hard to keep pumping out lineups when your debut was The Flaming Lips. However, I always love going. Hinterland in St. Charles was a great experience when I attended as well.",

Also bring a photo ID, birth certificate, and social security card. They will need those for the onboarding process.\n\n\nThe first day is usually a lot of general training. You will get a standard training on what the expectations are for the internship along with being introduced to the company policies.

I think the biggest thing is the menu resets every 2 weeks, so after a year of dining center life you'll have tried everything it has to offer. In terms of how it compares to high school lunch, I'd say it's on par (not really better or worse), but you do have more options. For example, if I didn't like what was on the menu that day I could default to cereal, pasta, or salad which were always available. I do recommend having a stash of snacks for when the dining center is not open (early morning and late at night) or don't feel like walking over to one. These can either be purchased via the grace of your parents or most dining plans come with dining dollars you can use at campus convenience stores. Disclaimer: take my review with a grain of salt as I attended dining centers pre-pandemic; I'm not sure if they've recovered a full selection of options post-pandemic. P.S.

You will get tired of it, so it\u2019s important to make sure you\u2019re trying different dining halls. I\u2019m not anywhere near seasons, but I only started going second semester and that has helped to give me more options. It\u2019s normal to want to go out, as well, so you still have that option. \n\nI don\u2019t know how good your high school lunch is but mine was pretty good, and I\u2019d say the dining halls here are miles better. I think it\u2019s best to start with the cardinal plan, and then you reevaluate how much you like the dining halls for second semester. If you just want more flex meals, then the cyclone plan might be a good option. The cardinal plan, though, is more than enough for most people. \n\nOverall, I like the dining halls a lot, considering it\u2019s incredibly easy to grab something quick and head to class. You\u2019ll have a lot of options as long as you check out each dining hall and try different flex meal locations.",

I thought what he said was very cliche and cheesy at the time, but it\u2019s true, 4 years is gonna fly by fast and the next thing you know, you\u2019re on the stage with your peers getting your degree.

Having been someone who didn\u2019t have an internship before graduation, getting a job after graduation without an internship all depends on your project experience and your GPA. I graduated in May and spent 2 months to study for the FE EIT license. Was licensed in August and started to apply, finally landed a job in May. It took me 8 months to land my first job. Although, I do agree that not being picky with your first job or industry will help you land one quicker. Don\u2019t be afraid to look into recruiting/contract companies like Palmer Group or Actalent if you\u2019re finding difficulty in getting interviews.\n\nHaving an internship by sophomore year isn\u2019t crucial but just getting one before graduation will help immensely. Internships aren\u2019t available to post graduates. \n\nRegarding the license. I can speak to this since I have my EIT from passing the FE exam. It\u2019s not needed at all depending on the industry you go into. As a civil engineer, it\u2019s common to have to need one because as you advance in this career, if you become a PE, you will need to be licensed to sign off on design drawings and such. This isn\u2019t really the same in ME unless this is the path you intend on following. An EIT license can help you leverage yourself against other candidates in the application pool if you have weak academics and no internship experience. I do agree also that it will help with well-roundedness and provide more opportunities in more industries. Hope this helps and good luck.",

The professors make an attempt to help the students learn in class and answer questions instead of requiring you find extra time in your week to attend office hours or SI.\n\nIf anyone wants a recommendation: Nancy Woods at the Boone DMACC is easily the best professor I have ever had.

Anywhere you want to work at would probably be there, for CBE I would guess there would especially be a lot of employees for agricultural products like pesticides but also a lot of plastic plants and things like that. You name it you\u2019ll find employers.\n\n2) sorry I\u2019m not in this program\n\n3) for grad students most will either split apartments off campus, or for school run housing a lot live in University Village. I\u2019ll be honest they\u2019re not nice but they do have air conditioning and are perfectly livable. That\u2019s like 3000 per year if you split a townhouse with someone, and you don\u2019t have to pay utilities or internet.\n\n4) I can\u2019t estimate but few places are cheaper than Iowa so you\u2019ll probably have an easier time saving here than almost any other university\n\nHope that helps!

Unsure if your instructor will structure it the same though. I had it with Mitra, who by all accounts, is quite literally the best professor that teaches the class. \n\nI\u2019m very thankful that I was able to take it by itself without needing to work, because I\u2019m not sure how I would\u2019ve managed. If I\u2019m being totally honest, working 40 hours a week during the summer semester will make passing extremely difficult if you don\u2019t already have a good understanding of algorithms. Few undergraduate classes match the sheer brutality of 311. \n\nIf you must do both during the summer, here\u2019s what you should do:\n\n1. Find a section that starts in June. \n2. After finals in May, really enjoy the hell out of yourself for one weekend. Relax like you\u2019ve never relaxed before because you\u2019ll need the energy.\n3. Get an algorithms textbook, find a whiteboard, and begin to ACTIVELY study. Meaning that your study sessions will be you, on your feet, painstakingly working out the intricacies of the textbook material. And you will keep doing this as much as time will allow in between your co-op work until class begins. \n4. Survive the horrors of 311. \n\nGood luck.",

I think it's pretty obvious based on the top schools that this is kind of an academic popularity contest, and it measures people's top choice (that they got accepted at). Another way of saying that is that high scorers aren't a 'safety school' for a lot of people. One factor that could influence the data is that Iowa uses the same acceptance criteria for all its public universities, so fewer people apply to all of them. \n\nBut the reason ISU has 6 points on Iowa would probably have to do with popularity/public perception (which could be tied to a lot of things) or because they have a reputation within specific majors that makes them a top pick. I can't really say more than that, but that would be my interpretation of the chart.",

In my opinion, and honestly probably 90% of people will agree, ISU\u2019s campus is just simply a lot better than UI, which I\u2019m guessing you\u2019ve visited being from Iowa City.\n\nVisit buildings related to your major, if you\u2019ve picked one. For example, Business majors main building is Gerdin, and a decent amount of your classes will be in central campus/ the east side of campus. Engineers will almost exclusively have classes on the west side of campus (and a little bit central). Ask your guide if you\u2019d like to know which buildings are related to your major! You\u2019ll be able to see cool equipment and labs if you have an interest in technical majors (food sci has a ton of food labs, a beer brewing lab, and an ice cream shop, and engineers have tons of expensive, state of the art research and manufacturing equipment for example).\n\nAs for safety, just look at the statistics. Nowhere in Iowa is particularly dangerous, but ISU and UI have to publish crime statistics each year being state universities. UI, being in Iowa City, has significantly more crime than ISU in Ames. Ames is a lot safer than Iowa City.\n\nYou can bring your car if you want, the cost of a parking pass is around $60/semester. Pick any lot other than the Stadium lots because you\u2019ll have to move your car before game days or they\u2019ll tow you. Just a heads up, we have CyRide, which is a really easy to use bus system that gets you to pretty much anywhere in Ames from campus, and runs frequently. So you can get on a bus on campus and get dropped off literally at the doors of a Target/Walmart if you need. Cars aren\u2019t super necessary in Ames. You can also bike, there are bike racks at most buildings on campus.",

The courses that I've taken were somewhat challenging, but are very passable with enough study time.  Be prepared to spend some quality time in the labs as well.  But the content is pretty manageable imo.  The professors range from fantastic to bad, but most of the professors I have had were at least decent.  There are plenty of resources online to help if you don't understand a professor too.\n\n2) The innovation center has some spaces for students to collaborate, some computer labs, and some club spaces.  It's a nice place to work on group projects.  I believe (although I haven't used them personally) they also have some equipment like 3D printers for fabricating stuff.\n\n3) Not sure what exactly you mean by \"community\", but most of my friends are in the department, so there's plenty of good people around to meet and interact with.  I'd recommend meeting some people to work on homework with too, it really helps if you struggle with a concept.\n\nHope this helps!",

If you are interested in programming with physical devices and digital logic SE would be better if you want a broad experience within programming. Also classes in Software Architecture, Design and testing are specific to SE. Also with SE there\u2019s a lot of flexibility in the kind of classes you can take since you can take a CPRE class or Coms class. This is helpful because for some the harder classes past coms 227/228 have professors who make their classes difficult but do not have the ability to teach compared to higher level CPRE classes where the professors are better at teaching complex material. However I would suggest majoring in CS if you are interested in being in a graduate program or doing research.",

If you take the time you can give yourself a solid chance of walking away with a new grad job paying anywhere from 75k to 240k / yr. The higher the income the more competitive the hiring process is though.   \n\nI think you should first make sure you have an extremely strong understanding of US immigration laws regarding student visas / H1Bs and also the consequences that come from being dependent on a company to sponsor your future work visas for you to actually stay in the country.",

I also think, as someone in the college of engineering, they do a fantastic job of preparing people for their careers, and I\u2019ve heard similar in other areas of study as well. I transferred from a school that is a little more English and humanities focused that happened to have a decent engineering program, and overall I think our school is certainly more diverse in its endeavors than a lot of other schools I\u2019m familiar with. There are also tons of incredible people, sports, clubs, and faculty here. I may be biased, but I think Iowa state is an excellent choice!",

There's not a huge pipeline from Iowa State specifically for this, but it's still doable with the right connections.\n\n3) music academia - if you are the kind of person who can see yourself in academia your whole life, and feel driven to do it, this is again possible.\n\n4) being a freelance composer/musician - this is a hard path. You won't be able to support yourself only by making music for a long time. That's not to say it's impossible, but it will take years of grinding. There are a number of YouTubers that are also musicians that can give some helpful perspective on this. For composition specifically, you might be interested in this video by David Bruce that reflects on his career as a composer: https://youtu.be/5Yyr33E4BV4\n\nIf none of these seem appealing - you can still be a musician or composer on a part-time basis.

I loved music as much as the next guy, and almost studied opera (before I moved here to go to school), and ultimately decided to go with engineering (not electrical). The job prospects in the music industry is just so competitive, and can be super draining if you\u2019re not  extremely dedicated. \n\nI work with musicians for my remote job, and it might be part of the reason I really don\u2019t want to go into the field. If you\u2019re not doing production, you\u2019ll probably end up as a teacher. It doesn\u2019t sound like you\u2019re doing theatre, so luckily you probably won\u2019t end up working at a grocery store like a lot of my theatre major friends did. \n\nMy partner and I have opted to have music be a hobby, and make money so we can buy pretty much any music equipment we could ever need. \n\nObviously do what makes you happy \u2014 ultimately you do not need to force yourself to do something you don\u2019t enjoy, life is too short for that. Just wanted to offer my perspective since I\u2019ve been in your position before.",

I'm not sure if wet frats even exist anymore but honestly I'd avoid wet and look for a dry house. It's easy to drink in college, but if you can at least keep it out of your house you'll have more success. If you're outgoing and want to be a part of every activity then go for it. I found the constant never ending \"mandatory\" activities to be exhausting. I wish I would have spent more time getting involved in on-campus groups but the frat had non stop commitments that you were expected to be a part of. I came out of it with a couple good friends I wouldn't trade for the world, but overall it wasn't the best experience for me.\n\nAlso you should know that they really sell the greek system as resume building, networking etc but in the real world it doesn't mean a fucking thing having greek letters next to your name, and in some cases it can have a negative context.

Many fraternities will do most of their recruiting over the summer before freshmen even step foot on campus. I would recommend finding the contact of a chapter\u2019s recruitment chair and setting up a meeting. \n\nMost Important: Be aware of what you want to get out of the experience when you start going thru the rush (recruitment) process. Each house has different strengths and weaknesses. \n\nThe Greek System is an excellent way to make friends and make connections with people. Just be conscious of if you want these connections to be solely drinking buddies, or if you want them to also be academic peers and supporters of your values.",

I lived in Oak-Elm and it was super quiet and not very social, but is nice because it is smaller. In terms of suites vs singles vs regular, I think that it mostly comes down to money.

If you don\u2019t know what classes to take each major has a 4 year plan you can look up. First semester your advisor will walk you through the scheduling process. Then do it yourself because advisors deal with a huge number of students at the same time, so only really email your advisor to reserve classes that have full sections or if you need to drop a class or switch sections. Lastly, you may not graduate in 4 years don\u2019t worry it\u2019s more common than you think. Take a co-op/internship over missing one semester of school the experience is worth it.",

I am also on my third advisor now so if you get a good one don't expect to have them forever cause everyone I know has had at least 2 advisors. \n\nMost of my professors were just bad at teaching, specifically the math professors (ended up transferring all of my math classes) and the statics professors (I know it's a hard class but the professor I had at a community college taught it so much better). Even this semester in my higher level classes, I still don't have professors who teach well (and one of them has an incredibly thick accent). If you worked really hard in high school and did super well then you might be ok but it'll definitely be a struggle. My friend who is a good bit smarter than me barely graduated on time and only really did graduate on time because he could make one of his classes pass/fail for the first semester of covid.",

Also doesn\u2019t serve dinner as others pointed out. \n\nMy vote would have gone to +39 which used to be where brick city grill is on Stange, but they obviously didn\u2019t get enough academia traffic to fit this description either. Provisions kinda fits the bill, especially due to its location, but that place is genuinely good. Ames isn\u2019t really a place where a parasitic pretentious place would survive long anyway.",

Right now, I really like Joe's KC pulled pork and Z Man sandwiches, Gate's half chicken and Porky's Blazin's brisket. I have been to many places, but only a fraction of them, it's kind of every street corner around here.\n\nI'd say you should make an effort to go to the classics in KC: Gate's, Arthur Bryant's, and Rosedale.

Of course no language is \"easy\" to learn, but Mandarin is especially difficult, because of how different it is from English (Non-romanized, non phonetic alphabet, along with there being no tenses in Mandarin). It would probably take much more the time to become equally proficient in speaking Mandarin than languages with Latin bases and an extremely long time to even understand basic phrases in writing that you would see in your day-to-day. With that being said, Mandarin is probably one of the most interesting languages in the world, because of it's rich history and how unique it is. I would not worry about GPA so much as the sheer time commitment it takes to learn.",

As far as RS goes, talk to the university about increasing funding to the department so they can properly teach the full range of RS courses. They're constantly being sidelined and ignored and defunded. Full professors leave or retire and are not replaced. It takes time for those at associate and assistant rank to progress to full professor. But they're all excellent teachers, regardless of rank, both the tenure-line professors and the teaching professors.",

They are working on a tournament next month, I think in Urbandale. \n\nI definitely recommend baduk to anyone who wants a good passive hobby that you can do on your phone instead of doom scrolling -- but also to people interested in getting super into the game and studying to get better. There are Professional players who spend their whole lives studying the game, much like chess Grand Masters. \n\nThough I hesitate to mention chess, because I find baduk much more engaging (less about memorizing openings), and also the baduk community is much more welcoming, in my opinion. \n\nAnyway, hope y'all are doing well with your club up on Ames! I graduated from ISU about a decade again, and still have friends made through baduk!",

        "body": "current GWC freshman here! (lengthy response ahead...)\n\nthere's usually a few required things which you should be able to find on the website. i can list some.\n\n1. service hours - \n\nthis year, our cohort didn't have to because they changed some stuff around ? but next semester we're required to serve 20 hours OUTSIDE of campus. it's usually 10 every semester but our cohort will have double to make up for this year.\n\n2. ISCORE -\n\nit's a conference held here on campus and you're required to attend it because scholars present during that day about social issues. it's really easy and you go over it in class during the semester so minimal outside work. it's not like you present on stage, you just have a booth with a poster, kind of like in career fairs.\n\n3. UST courses -\n\ni don't know if this applies to all majors but i'm guessing it is, but there's a us diversity requirement of 3 credits, and if you take UST 105, 106, and 205, you've basically got that covered because each class is 1 credit, so not a whole lot of time commitment. super easy to pass (it's a requirement to pass the class or you lose the scholarship).\n\n4. 2.5 GPA minimum -\n\neach semester, you need to maintain a 2.5 GPA or you lose the scholarship. faculty will understand that you're a first semester student and you're trying to figure out how college works, so go talk to them if you're not confident because they're more lenient. if you do end up going under 2.5, usually, they'll have you file an appeal.\n\njust don't slack off is my best advice. i've always been a 4.0 student in high school so i thought i'd do well in my classes, but oh boy was i humbled. it adds up, and i even had to talk to my GWC instructor for it, but thankfully, i passed 2.5.\n\n5. required events -\n\nall throughout the semester, you're required to attend a minimum of 3 events hosted by the Multicultural Student Affairs (MSA). these could include the lecture series, empower hours, social events, etc. you have to prove attendance such as swiping your id card or just take a picture for backup if they do ask for proof. you then make a one page, double spaces reflection of it. super easy. plus, a lot of these events are fun!! painting pottery, afterdark, latinx cultural night, etc. lots of food!!\n\nPRO TIP THOUGH!! DO THEM EARLY!! things pile up week after week, and a lot of these events, you might not be able to go to because of exams, quizzes, extracurriculars, other commitments, or class schedule conflicts. get them done as early as possible because there's a hard deadline!! learned it the hard way!!\n\n\nCONGRATULATIONS!!!\n\nthere might be a few more i'm missing, but most of these are things that don't require much sweat unless you want it to be. as long as you're on top of these things, you should be fine, and they automatically renew as long as you do whatever is asked of you. i think you do have to file for FAFSA every year ? they remind you of your requirements throughout the semester, so honestly, don't worry too much. \n\nif you do have any questions you're curious about, please let me know! i'll be more than glad to help you out!",

        "body": "Thanks for the information here. Our son was offered the GWC scholar opportunity and Iowa State has been on the top of his college list because of this. Has anyone heard if this new Iowa bill defunding DEI will ultimately defund the GWC scholar program? I did read through the entire bill and I presume the state could do this. It says nothing specific about scholarship money in the bill, but presumably the program itself supports  underrepresented students and thus could be in scope. This is concerning -- not to mention sending our kid to a state that feels this is necessary. I guess it is election time. During the last election our kid got death threats for being hispanic\u2026\u2026that was in a blue state. I am curious if Iowa is the right place now. This is frustrating. I\u2019m concerned that even calling the University won\u2019t get us a clear response as the bill is not even passed yet. Just curious what current GWC scholars are perhaps hearing on campus?",

I think you\u2019d be fine most likely from a financial standpoint, as any changes would most likely take a couple of years to plan and implement. But from what I heard when I visited campus last fall, a lot has changed in Iowa in the past 10 years politically and socially, so I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if that has crept onto campus too. Due to Covid there are also fewer international students , which then decreases diversity further.",

        "body": "I lived in helser all of freshman year and got a good idea of how each of the union drive dorms felt like. Friley is a mostly quiet dorm. Some houses are noisy but everything is so spread out that in order to talk to people you have to find them first. The old hall also doesn't bode well bathroom wise. Martin and Eton are the good dorms. Private bathrooms but shared living quarters mean you will become good friends with those you live with, but a bad match leads to a bad experience. Single dorms are best for putting your nose to the grindstone. Now helser, helser is a whole other beast. Most freshman it has a party atmosphere most weekends and was a ton of fun to socialize. No ac means that people huddle in the dens early in the semester and get to know each other really well. This of course comes with downsides as especially as a junior you are gonna get hard classes and need to focus at 12 a night rather than investigating why chuck down the hall is cry/laughing on a wensday night. Random roommate is also luck of the draw, and if at all possible, find someone you can halfway tolerate before transferring. Most people doing random roommates are either freshman or desperate. Try to find where your classes are going to be and pick a close dorm. It's that or learn the bus route. I can give more insight on other dorms too.",

However, I didn't take it as seriously as I should have as I had already secured a job. I wasn't going for a masters and was just taking it because it looked interesting.\n\nI was able to do well in COMS 311 because it involved a lot of programming mixed with proofs. COMS 511 is all rigorous and formal proofs and everything is very abstract. You'll learn about Network Flow algorithms such as Fold-Fulkerson and Edmonds-Karp at a very deep level. You will have to be able to use these and many other algorithm's properties to solve other problems. You will learn about many different problems that are NP-Complete as well as how they were derived from 3SAT or other NP-Complete problems. \n\nIt requires a lot of very deep and complex thought to be able to understand a problem, it's solution, and how that solution mechanism could be used to solve other problems. When I saw questions on homework or exams, I spent most of my time trying to understand what the questions were asking in the first place because of how much intricate language was used. It feels very rewarding when you finally put the pieces together.\n\nDr. Eulenstein is pretty good but I very rarely understood lecture and usually just read the book and slides. If you want to learn about algorithms deeply, it's very interesting!",

I got a 50/100 and my friends both got 54 and 56 but managed Bs. No curve.\n\n2) The problem for me was that when it started with Big O I thought I knew enough. I got (80 - 100) /100 on the homeworks and didn't feel like I needed to study that hard. Big mistake, once it got hard every lecture built off the previous one. Even though I rarely missed lecture, if you don't fully understand what was taught the last lecture, then you will learn nothing from this lecture, and the snowball will begin. I also think they are much more lenient with homework than with exams. Both exams I got about 50/100. I'm about to start a masters with Georgia Tech's OMSCS, they have an algorithms course that seems to be equivalently difficult. I am not worried about going through this material again because if I had given the time and effort needed all throughout the course instead of just the second half I think I could have maintained a B. Also utilize the TAs! I definitely should have done that!\n\n3. I think he did a good job with the course. He told us exactly what concepts would appear on the exam so we knew what to study. It's very difficult to grade proofs, but that was mostly to my advantage. Some of the problems had specific solutions that I didn't know about, so TAs had an easy time grading those proofs. But when I turned in my round-about 3 page proof where I use everything I've ever learned to solve this problem I've never seen before I think they just trusted my answer. Oliver has a very strong accent that can be difficult to understand for a while and his handwriting is not good, but I eventually got through that part. \n\n4. The 2 exams are the same style as the homework. The homework will have 2-3 questions and will take more time to solve usually and require a lot of studying. The exams will have around 7 questions and will have very elegant and clear solutions - as long as you deeply understand the problem. Every exam will have the same problems shown in lecture, however with some tiny twist very deep in the problem. Solving the problems should be very easy if everything about the algorithm is deeply understood, else it will seem impossible to solve and you probably won't even know what the question is asking. If you follow him in lecture you should do well on the exams.",

There is a national regulatory board, [IACUC](https://www.aalas.org/iacuc) and researchers have to lay out every step of the procedures, how they're housing and feeding the animals, how they're providing pain relief, etc. They also have to prove that the research question they're trying to answer cannot be done without the use of the animal model and that their method is the most pain-free and ethical way possible to carry out the experiment.

It's much more boring, involving a ton of paperwork. Universities have an Institutional Review Board that has to approve proposals for anything involving live subjects, even those random psych studies you can sign up for. ISU specifically has the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) that approves animal research. \n\nHere's an example of a paper from ISU with an animal testing component if you want an example: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.actbio.2019.10.016\n\nhttps://www.compliance.iastate.edu/committees/iacuc\n\nEvery grad student at Iowa State takes an ethics course that outlines this.

        "body": "I did read them. Snopes said that some of the claims are true and others are false. To quote them \u2018Mixture.\u2019 The Atlantic pointed out the disturbingly high euthanasia rates, and so did Newsweek. Snopes also reported on instances in which PETA employees were arrested, although not charged, for stealing people\u2019s pets. They also referenced the case of a chihuahua, where PETA employees attempted to coerce the dog off of the family\u2019s porch, then, when that failed, grabbed the dog right off of the porch themselves. When the family later contacted PETA, after reviewing security footage to find out what had happened, they informed the family that the dog had been euthanized. In this case, PETA was found guilty and fined $50,000. \n\nAs mentioned in the Atlantic, Snopes, and pretty much all of the sources, I think. PETA has an issue with euthanasia. They have very high euthanasia rates for a group that claims to protect animals. So much so, that according to NBC12, the Virginia senate passed a law to clarify that animal shelters exist to find pets a permanent home. \n\nhttps://www.nbc12.com/story/28699856/euthanasia-controversy-sparks-new-law/\n\nHowever, in my view, it seems that PETA is all about the appearance and not about results. They pay people to make posts on social media about using a term for an animal in reference to a human behavior, is derogatory to animals and perpetuating that \u2018humans are superior to other animals.\u2019 For example, calling someone who is acting in a cowardly fashion \u2018chicken.\u2019 \nMeanwhile, they\u2019re euthanizing 80% of the animals that they took in\u2026. Seems somehow off to me. So, let me get this straight PETA, it\u2019s derogatory toward the animal to call a human a insult relating to animals, but it\u2019s perfectly fine to kill them. Ok. I\u2019m surprised that PETA doesn\u2019t advocate for human euthanasia, since they euthanize animals and consider humans to be on the same footing as animals. But, I digress.\n\nAs far as the other two go, yes, they are paid marketing, but that doesn\u2019t make what they say to be a lie. It\u2019s sort of like auto insurance companies saying that a disproportionately high amount of accidents occur due to texting while driving and excessive speed, so you should download our app to that tracks your driving habits to get a better rate. ProtectTheHarvest interviewed a former PETA employee, allegedly. Maybe, she wasn\u2019t really a former PETA employee. I don\u2019t know.\n13NewsNow claims she is. Are they actually a news agency? Also, why is she in Honduras? I don\u2019t know the answers to these things. \n\nhttps://www.13newsnow.com/amp/article/news/local/former-peta-employee-calls-group-deceptive/291-418016794\n\nLook, I think that both of us want what\u2019s best for animals. You may think that PETA is a force for good in this regard. I think that what they say and their slogans are good, but in action they are not a force for good. You have your opinion on PETA and I have mine.",

I don't think you'd care because you're graduating. You may also not want to use them as a reference for your next job due to leaving before your contract.\n\nI'm sure they are very used to people leaving before the contract ends. Also, people quit without giving two week notices all the time. It's fine.\n\nIf they ask if you can stay for two semesters, be honest. If you can work through summer break, mention that. Some graduates stay in Ames for the summer while looking for work, I don't know if that's you. You could also ask if continuing to work after graduation is a problem. Perhaps you didn't anticipate getting an awesome job offer (of course you did), and that's why you suddenly have to leave.",

It definitely is a lot of work outside of class, but it is def doable to take both at the same time. \n\nDynamics (for me) was way tougher than mechanics. But with ample studying and extra youtube videos (Jeff Hanson), neither are necessarily very difficult. And you\u2019ll find this out with many classes, is that if you put the time and effort into learning the material and doing problems, you actually learn and get good grades!! Seems simple but it took me a while to learn that lol. \n\nThe main thing is to be prepared to dedicate a lot of time to these as well as the rest of your classes. If you have a job or want to have a social life, then you might consider your workload and might have to switch a class out for an easier one. Good luck!",

Eubanks, 335 N.W.2d 57, 59,\n(Iowa 1984), our court found the odor of marijuana by itself was adequate probable cause for a warrantless search, stating, \u201cIn addressing the smell of marijuana supporting a vehicle search, our supreme court has held \u201ca trained officer\u2019s detection of a sufficiently distinctive odor, by itself or when accompanied by other facts, may establish probable cause.\u201d \n\nState v. Stewart, No. 17-0705, 2018 WL 2084832, at *2 (Iowa Ct. App. May 2, 2018) (emphasis added).\n In Eubanks, the supreme court determined \u201c[T]he patrolman clearly had sufficient probable cause to search the vehicle and its contents\u201d based on the fact he \u201csmelled the odor of marijuana drifting from the car when he approached defendant, who was seated behind the steering wheel.\u201d 355 N.W.2d at 59; see also \n\nState v. Pickering, No. 16-1272, 2017 WL 1405913, at *1 (Iowa Ct. App. Apr.13, 19, 2017) (\u201cAfter initiating the traffic stop, the deputy detected the smell of marijuana wafting from the vehicle as the driver was exiting the vehicle. This is sufficient to establish probable cause to search further.\u201d); \n\nAs for Iowa state, they are notified about all violent, drug, and vandalism related charges. However, I doubt they will do anything about it since it\u2019s no biggie\n\n\nIf you do consider legal action, submit a \u201cFOIA\u201d request for the bodycam footage and traffic stop information.

I had to meet with someone from ISU and the guy was super cool about it. He basically said it wasnt a big deal and it wouldnt affect my standing at ISU. He said it wouldnt be a big deal if I were to get caught again. It was a huge relief. It might affect financial aid, depending on what you got going on. I was given a deferred judgement since it was my first offence and I had to pay a ~300 dollar fine and was on probation for like 7 or 8 months. My probation officer was very nice and understanding. She said to try to pay off the fine as soon as possible and to not smoke on probation. I was never drug tested during probation, but I would still avoid it. If its your first time getting in trouble in Iowa, you will most likely get a deferred judment, which means that after your probation, your record will be sealed to some degree and you can say that you have not gotten in trouble when you fill out forms asking if youve ever been arrested for xyz. Also, I had a public defender, so If you cant afford a private one, the public ones arent so bad. The only thing im unsure about is that your offense was an OWI, which is different from my case.

They may be connected but not necessarily. If someone is on SAP Warning or Suspension, an appeal is required to receive financial aid again.\n\nGenerally, if either appeal has been denied it's because the student has been able to show that their circumstances have improved and they are ready to have a successful semester.

I don't know your friend but going home and taking some time to reflect on what is important to them may not be the worst thing in times of challenge.\n\nI didn't go home and kept trying and trying and failing. I hit ROCK bottom. While I learned about hard work, I would not recommend doing academic or financial damage when things are not working. Sadly we need to figure ourselves out before going and embarking on these kinds of things. It could be that we just don't have all of the details. If you want to be a good friend, help them get whatever it is that can help them, even if that means a change in geography or mental health care near home to process what is happening. Helping them understand that this is common will be important to reduce stigma. I know for me I needed to hear other people's stories. [This talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6x9wmlFz_c) in particular was helpful for me. Amazing how far we've come on the mental help discussion in 10 years. They probably feel very guilty and may be hard on themselves. Coming back later is an option. Finding a spot closer to support systems may be the best thing you can help them understand as a friend. Sounds like you are concerned which is really caring of you.",

The latter involved using a simulation software that is probably 40 years old and recording data from manipulating various sliders. So, while you can definitely pass with minimal effort each week, it may be fruitful to take some extra time to study the topics on your own during any lulls in your internship (in the event you go with iwcc).",

I know some SAE teams are more competitive than others. PrISUm is fine with whoever wants to drive you just have to be trained and put under insurance and stuff. But I will say that the clubs are not very constant racing if that's what you are looking for. It's 90% engineering + building/planning/meetings/work-days and then 10% racing. So keep that in mind! Feel free to check out these sites:  \n\n\n[https://www.stuorg.iastate.edu](https://www.stuorg.iastate.edu) \\-> main ISU club page, you can search their names to find more info and contact info and stuff.  \n\n\n[https://www.prisum.org](https://www.prisum.org) \\-> PrISUm/Solar car. Make a solar car every 3-4 years then race them in a competition called American Solar Challenge(happens every 2 years) and do occasional track meets.\n\n  \n[https://stuorgs.engineering.iastate.edu/sae/baja/](https://stuorgs.engineering.iastate.edu/sae/baja/) \\-> Website for all SAE related clubs.  \n\n\nFeel free to dm me with questions you have. I can not speak as much as on the baja side but can speak on the PrISUm side of things.",

You need to think about nutrient dense foods, and what meals you plan on making. Going to the groccery store with a list of ingredients and an idea of what type of food and meals you would like to make is the biggest step.\n\nFrom there, planning out your meals ahead of time, tuesday I'll roast a chicken and eat it with a salad and bread for dinner. Wednesdays i'll make leftovers from chicken into a chicken noodle soup, now i have soup for the week. ect ect. \n\nIt all stems from a bank of techniques and reciepes you have in your mind. Cooking is not an over night process, it takes years to get good at planning and cooking your meals out. The better you are the more efficent you are at it, the more you can buy the same ingredients but also make different types/flavors of meals from the same said ingredients it all comes from techniques and reciepes we already know. \n\nWHen it comes to time and cleaning, CLEAN while you COOK. I laid a piece of chicken down on the pan, i'm going to wash the stuff i used to prep it. Cut and prep all your raw ingredients before the heat even gets turned on on the stove. Clean while you are waiting for said food to cook. By the time you sit down to eat, your kitchen should already be clean. \n\nIt is a process and it takes time. Alidis' is the cheapest way to go in terms of groceries in Ames. It's expensive else where. I make gourmet meals that are restaurant quality, yet i only spend about 50 dollars a week on grocceries and i dont eat out.",

It seemed like everyone my age/year had already established their friend groups and weren\u2019t looking for newbies. \n\nI lived on campus which helped. My random roommate was also a transfer student and we became good friends. I got involved in my dorm leadership team to meet more people. I wouldn\u2019t say I was \u201cfriends\u201d with many of them, but it\u2019s nice to have acquaintances to chat with and who know you exist. \n\nI had an internship/job and am still in touch with quite a few of my coworkers. \n\nI joined one club relevant to my major that would look good on my resume. Try to find a smaller, more niche club where you can make a bigger impact. Some clubs have 100s of people and if you\u2019re an introvert, it\u2019s hard to find your way into the group. I personally found clubs boring unless I had a chair position, I liked to be actively engaged, not a passive attendee. If nothing else, it\u2019ll keep you busy and add to your resume. \n\nIf you\u2019re even slightly religious, look at joining a church group. They seemed to have the most close knit fellowship and are generally very nice people. \n\nFind a girlfriend/boyfriend. Easier said than done. But obviously helps fill your time. \n\nTake care of yourself. Go to the gym, take fitness classes. Iowa State has a club for everything but the Ames community also has some clubs. One friend made a lot of friends in the ROTC fitness class, mainly because it was brutally early and they could commiserate lol. \n\nIt probably took me a year to feel happy on campus. Until then I just made sure to keep busy. I personally liked having structure so I would plan out all my evenings. And keep in touch with your family and friends from community college or high school.",

The under 4 timeout where we play the slowed-down fight song to go with whoever is trundling along on the upper deck with the flag drains energy right at the key point in the game. I\u2019d rather hear juicy wiggle or sandstorm or some other hype song at the under 4, especially if the game is a close one. There\u2019s lots of big moments in basketball where the band playing gets drowned out by the crowd anyway, and using a different song would boost the crowd more.\n\nThey are definitely still key, but moderation is the biggest thing. There\u2019s a balance to be had to create the best atmosphere. Plus, wearing yellow shirts when the theme is whiteout is ridiculous. They should\u2019ve wore white as well with everyone else. Just makes them look like a stain in what otherwise was a fantastic photo of Hilton from Tuesday",

I still strongly encourage to do them as they are closely related to what might appear on exams - when I took these courses (ranging from Spring 2021 through Fall 2022) the exams were all online take home exams - so being able to look back on homework and see what I did was very beneficial.   \n\n\nThe lectures are theory heavy, but while not required for you grade, there are many important pieces of information given that are not in the PowerPoints and lecture notes. It is also where Lynna goes through code demos, which if you don't attend lecture can be difficult to understand. This is very much important as most of the homework and exam answers can be gained from these answers.   \n\n\nPersonally I would not take another course with her again, not because her courses are bad, or that she is an unfair professor.

        "body": "Try a Push, Pull, Legs split. In my opinion, and a lot of other people, it is the most optimal in terms of hitting each muscle group and being efficient in the gym. For example, on Monday, do chest, triceps, and shoulders (pushing), on Tuesday do back and biceps (pulling), and Wednesday do legs. You can repeat this again and then do a rest day on the 7th day of the week if you are really committed, but ofc you can modify it to suit your needs. As far as what workouts to do, there\u2019s tons of information online and the best way to learn is to just go in and try it. One piece of advice I have tho, don\u2019t listen to social media gym \u201cinfluencers\u201d because they tend to provide incorrect information, too complex information for beginners, and assume you have 3 hours to go to the gym which most people don\u2019t. Keep it simple, lift heavy (with good form), 8-12 reps, slow and controlled with high intensity. \n\nUltimately, it all depends on your goals. It is most beneficial to train a muscle group 2x per week, hence the Push, pull, legs being preferred. As some people have mentioned, a full body split is nice, but imo you need to dedicate more time to each muscle group",

Math reviews are provided in case you forgot diff eq or didn't learn it well :).\n\nI took ME 421 with Professor Schafbuch and really enjoyed the course. Prof. Schafbuch is super nice and also a great lecturer. He was a controls engineer for Emerson, so he has quite a few industrial insights to offer as well. The course involves modeling systems with differential equations and some fun mathematical manipulations. Prof. Schafbuch did a pretty good job of explaining problem solving processes. He provided reviews of all the math we needed to solve problems. Homework and practices reflected exams pretty well. You have to put in a fair amount of work to do well. \n\nLab was a lot easier and more organized than labs for Fluids and Heat Transfer. The TA would give us helpful mini lectures to help us with the math and important concepts. Lab reports were mostly just compilations of Matlab code and outputs. There was one written lab report, but it wasn't too bad. \n\nAfter putting in a lot of work in class and lab, I managed to get an A. \n\nTips for getting that A:\n- Go to all lectures and take notes\n- Use the shortcuts the professor gives on exams (otherwise you may not have time to finish)\n- Do all the written HW \n- Do any practice available (even if it is not graded)\n- Find a buddy to compare HW answers with\n- Go to office hours if you're a bit lost\n- Pay attention in lab\n\nEdit: Explaining that OP is probably not doomed.",

Everyone's situation is different and even if you have extreme interest there's only so many hours in the day and it can be a tough balancing act between school, work possibly, and your own mental health. So even if you're interested in the subject, some people really do care.\n\nThat said, in my own experience, while I haven't taken a religion class, the workloads are about the same because the they have the goal to reach the same material. The difference I see for myself is that online classes require extra motivation to tune into lectures or watch asynchronously if need be. It is a lot easier to skip a lecture if there's no physical place you need to be at. \n\nWith that, I prefer the in-person experience because it can be more interactive experience while the workload tends to be similar.\n\nSome classes I've taken have also been hybrid, some of these classes I've realized are just the professor lecturing at the students and I don't find a real benefit from being there in person. With these classes, I prefer to do them online because I don't have a car so it can be more convient to watch the lectures at home, but like I said before it can be very tempting to skip a lecture when I do this, which has bitten me the butt a few times.",

I would also study lecture topics I didn\u2019t understand when I had free time during the day so I didn\u2019t fall behind. \n\nI would study for tests for 4-10 hours each depending on the class, with the exception of Thermodynamics 2 because my thermo 1 prof taught me most of that stuff anyway lol. I never studied past 10:30PM as my brain seems to stop working right and I miss easy stuff and make simple errors every problem. I don\u2019t have a go to study strat either I just kinda go with the flow. \n\nThe way I see it, college is like a funny reverse job. I pay money to work. I treat it like a job where if I get my work done I will spend extra time reviewing and answering questions I have about lecture topics. My main rule only being that if possible always try to get enough sleep. \n\nSaturday was my off day and I mostly would game or hang out with my friends. Sunday was also a bit like Tuesday or Thursday since not much ever happens on sundays I could do a TON of work if I needed too. But to avoid burn out I typically didn\u2019t go crazy on sundays. \n\nOverall I like to have days where I do mostly class and down days with only 1 or 2 classes and time for lots of work. I spend 8-9 hours a day on average each week on school, which includes class, HW, and studying. Always try to keep good sleep, and have one rest day a week if possible. My best advice for the HW is do a topic right after the lecture and not before the due date. I feel like if something\u2019s fresh from lecture and I do the practice in the HW quickly it cements in my memory better than if I have to go back and check my notes a trillion times.",

The university does not tolerate racism and there are also students who don't realize that their comments can be hurtful as they lack experience.\n\nAfter your freshman year, I highly recommend checking out the university's UV apartments as there's a large population of international students.

In 2019, following some racist graffiti in a dormitory, an organization called Students Against Racism was founded and was aggressive in it's pursuit of justice. They did not have much success in getting their demands passed, and the college instead went with the typical \"special trainings\" approach to combating racism. Since this event, there hasn't really been any other forward movement on combating bigotry on campus.\n\nI have seen and heard some racist deeds and words on campus, including by students. I've heard racist and antisemitic jokes receive applause at open mic nights. I've seen slurs and hate symbols written on boards and sidewalks. I've seen folks supporting the preachers that come to spout hate at students. I've also seen incredible bravery. Student orgs taking on a slow to change administration face to face. Folks putting together anti-racist protests and leading marches across campus. People taking time to spread love in the free speech zone, rather than vitriol. Honestly, it's all about the people you surround yourself with here\n\nI cannot tell you what your experience will be at ISU, but I can say that you will probably be exposed to racist/bigoted people at some point. Ames is a fairly liberal part of Iowa, which certainly provide some level of inoculation from the bigots, but they're still there. Still, ISU is a good college with a beautiful campus and plenty of wonderful anti-racist people. If you do choose your adventure here, I hope it's what you're after!",

Utilize the Piazza and office hours when you need it and you should be perfectly fine. It's definitely a tedious class at times which can be annoying but overall it's good.\n\n319: When I took this class it was a lot of busy work and I didn't get too much out of it. However, it sounds like with the new prof it's taught a lot better and people are getting real value out of it which is great! It's not too difficult and won't take as much time compared to your other classes.\n\n309: Try to get into a good group and if you want to hate your life less, do backend. I took this class before one of my internships and I actually used a lot of the backend knowledge I picked up from 309. The documentation for both backend and frontend is outdated but backend is slightly less outdated. Android Studio (frontend) has a steep learning curve as well. However, it's really about what you want to work on at the end of the day so if your really want to do frontend, go for it!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOverall: Your semester will definitely be a busy one, but that's kind of the whole vibe of junior year.

Absolutely, especially for engineering. But there are going to be more dumb things in your future career than what is involved for Honors. And the community with Honors is one of my favorite.\n\nAs far as housing, do it 100%. Pick Harwood or Anders. Those two have the most tight knit communities and you'll get the most out of them. (Harwood is better and I will die on that hill)",

Aside from the friends I made it also had a great location (with its proximity to two dining centers, Windows being my favorite, and State gym).\n\nI also have a friend that lives in Harwood honors house over on east campus and he says their floor is really social as well, but that there are a decent number of upperclassman living there. Lorch-Russell was definitely more freshman then anything else (as well as engineering/design majors, since it\u2019s near those buildings) so it depends on what you\u2019re looking for.\n\nMy two main pieces of advice: (1) think about location, i.e. is it near your classes, dining halls, the majors/ages you want to be around, etc.; and (2) put yourself out there. It\u2019s probably really cliche and you\u2019ve probably heard it a lot, but just showing up in communal spaces and being friendly for those first couple of days (and I mean the first couple before class starts) can make a world of difference, and wherever you live will definitely be better if you\u2019re living with friends.",

Congrats you\u2019ve taken the exact same classes as the kid with a 2.9 except he/she spent 30 hours a week demonstrating that they had the chops to do more than learn from a textbook meanwhile you have nothing unique to talk about during interviews. \n\nI was a shitty student in class but my extracurricular experience led to some cool internships which then led to a really great job with pretty solid pay right out of school. \n\nI realize not every situation or major is the same but the biggest takeaway is to do something that sets you apart from the average student and that will do 90% of the work of getting you a decent job. The last 10% comes down to you knowing how to leverage that experience and demonstrating that you can bring something of value to a potential employer.",

I even know one guy who started at 150k for a sales position, but he had some other stuff going on that helped with that. I ended up doing grad engineering work, ended up making around 120k out the gate. \n\nOn the other end, I know two individuals who got biology degrees with middling grades. One got a job for 42k (eventually moved to IT for a >10k+ raise) while another got a job doing hourly non-profit work for about 35k (two years later, upgraded to a similar job paying 50k, then went to grad school). \n\nI don't know exact numbers on their jobs, but I have two other friends who got psych degrees and went into social work in the Des Moines area. My guess is a similar ballpark of 40k based on lifestyle (one lived with parents), although that work is burnout central and now both do other things. \n\nIn terms of non-ISU grads, I also know one teacher who makes in the 45k ballpark, and a nurse who makes a bit more than that (50-60k). The nurse got lucky during Covid and got some travel work to pull 6 figures that year, but now she's back to normal.\n\nHope that helps! For what it's worth, everyone I just mentioned has about the same level of happiness because they're doing stuff they care about and it pays the bills.

Calling me \"Responsible\" They don't do Guilty/Not Guilty, it's LITERALLY just a meeting w/ the Hall Director. Since then Nothings occurred with me and I'm assuming it wouldn't with you. You wont get a fine, you wont be contacted by the police you did nothing Illegal by having empty beer cans (So I assume I actually don't know), you wont lose your scholarships.

However, for me the exam was open notes 2 pages front and back. Practice exams are very good problems to study for as if you can do the entire practice exam you\u2019ll pass the class. The test is 100/130 and you\u2019re not expected to finish it. The class is just a million miles wide but 6 inches deep. Understand all the concepts and it\u2019ll flow together nicely. Do not miss class and don\u2019t skip studying or cheat on the homework and you\u2019ll do fine. The final  project is very tough on the time limit given\u2026 we had about 5 days for it. However, it\u2019s 6% of final grade and the first 3% are easy to get as long as you\u2019ve been paying attention in class and labs.

(However, if you failed any previous gen eds this is still applicable to the ones you haven\u2019t taken yet, but you will still be advised to retake the gen eds you failed in addition to the failed studio).\n\n- [ ] **Contact (not just) your studio professors before the spring semester starts to inform them of your situation in regards to taking both studio courses in one semester.**\n\nThey will be accommodating and it will at least give them better consideration and context for your situation! A lot of professors don\u2019t genuinely want to fail their students (ironic based on my initial post lol) and instead offer assistance, so please look into this!\n\n- [ ] **If retaking a studio course, try to get into the same section you were in the previous semester.**\n\nYou may be able to resubmit projects you did beforehand if your professor agrees to it, so it\u2019ll give you more time to work on the other design projects while in class! I specify getting into the same section since each design professor assigns different projects even when teaching the same studio.\n\n- [ ] **Depending on what major you are interested in, you could apply for the COD the following year while taking courses required for the major you\u2019re interested in.**\n\nHowever, remember that a lot of design majors are very restrictive on non design majors taking their courses, so be sure to look at the four/five year plan in advance on what you can do! Contact the advisors in the departments you are interested on applying for beforehand!\n\n- [ ] **Following what is mentioned above, don\u2019t retake the studio course in the spring and do so in an upcoming year if you are able to squeeze it in your schedule and get the newer grade!**\n\nYou may have to take summer courses for gen eds that are necessary after your freshman year to make room, however.",

After about 6 PM on Wednesday, conditions will rapidly deteriorate and will not normalize until the weekend.\n\nTravel will be very difficult. I personally expect around 6-8 inches of snow to fall, but the biggest factor will be the wind. Consistent winds of 20 MPH with gusts up to 40 MPH will be present for multiple days. Even when plows go out, their work will be quickly erased. Large drifts may form in inconvenient spots. Your vehicle will be pushed around on the highways.\n\nTemperatures will be brutal. We may not top a wind chill of -20 for 24 hours+. If you do need to travel any distance, please have a cold-weather kit. [This is what the NWS suggests.](https://www.weather.gov/media/top/prepare/CarWinterSurvivalKitChecklist.pdf)\n\nThere is no need to panic buy anything as four days is not a long time, but I do suggest making sure you have the things you need to stay home as much as possible during that stretch.\n\nPlease just be safe.

        "body": "Welcome! I can definitely tell you everything you need to know about CyRide. I'm an ISU graduate and have lived in Ames for about 10 years now and worked at CyRide for 8. \n ---\n**CyRide -** Can be intimidating at first, but once you figure it out it's pretty easy. The apps are useful, but I would recommend taking the time to read our printed bus schedule, because that is what we go by. Sometimes the apps and google transit get very confused whenever we go on break schedule so they might tell you a bus will be there when it isn't running. \n\nFor now, I would start by going to the CyRide website and look at the \"maps\" and \"schedules\" tab. You'll be riding Cardinal if you live in Freddy, and if you're planning on using the system for anything else besides class (such as grocery shopping,) you'll want to figure out routes that will also get you there.\n\n[This is our system map](https://www.cyride.com/Home/ShowDocument?id=9463). It seems like a lot at first, but if it's overwhelming just focus on one route and figure out where it goes. \n\n[This is what a timetable looks like](https://www.cyride.com/schedules/school-year-schedule/weekdays/21-cardinal). I selected #21 Cardinal since that is what you'll be riding. Those times in there are called \"timepoints.\" The bus will not leave those stops before the scheduled times. When you look at the [cardinal route map](https://www.cyride.com/home/showpublisheddocument/9991/637401732726630000), any of the square box stops are timepoints. \n\nOnce you get here, there are schedules in the buses - the first time you ride I would grab one and read the information in it.\n\nThe last information I'll leave you with is that you will need your student ID to ride most of the buses. Just show it to the driver, you don't need to scan it or anything. For any route that starts with a \"20\" (21 cardinal, 23 orange, 25 gold,) those are free buses and you don't need to show your ID. Every other bus you will (1 Red, 2 Green, 3 Blue, etc.)\n\n---\n\n**As a transfer student** - Not sure if you're coming from another university or if you're coming from a community college. I transferred from a community college and got my ass handed to me when I came here, and it took a lot of adjustment to orientate myself to the new standards. You will need to go to class and study in order to be successful, especially if you're doing anything in STEM. I used the private desks on floors 2 and 3 on the west side of parks library - I needed the peace and quiet in order to focus. I also made friends with some of my classmates and would work on stuff together - that seemed like it was the easiest way to form a \"study group.\" Group chats and discord channels are especially helpful with this if you're not able to meet up.\n\n---\n\n**Nightlife** - Welch Ave is generally going to be where all of the action is. All the \"bar\" bars are 21+, so if you're not old enough yet you'll have to wait. If partying is your scene, make some friends so you can attend some social night events. I can't tell you much about fraternities or sororities because that was not my cup of tea, but if that's something you're interested in it's a great way to make really good connections.\n\n---\n\n**Best places to eat** - I'm boring, but I really love Macubana on Welch. They serve some really good Cubanos, Burgers, and Mac and Cheese. I don't even want to know the amount of money I've spent there. I also really like 1+1 Chinese over on West street, along with West Street Deli. If you like Mexican food, El Azteca is my favorite for that and it's up in North Ames, along with Brick City Grill for American.\n\n---\n\n**Things to bring** - This advice is age-old, but buy a plunger before you need a plunger. Trust me. Other things that I didn't think about when moving in was a vacuum, broom, bath towels, kitchen towels, extra blankets. Someone should have kitchen knives but if they don't you'll want a set. I would communicate with your roommates because you won't want to buy duplicates of things if it can be shared.\n\n---\n\n**Jobs** - Almost everyone is hiring, so it shouldn't be too difficult getting a job. I would recommend starting with something at Iowa State first because they work around your schedule a lot easier than others. Otherwise there's always CyRide, but honestly we're getting to the point where we're almost hired up and aren't taking as many of the low-hour applicants. If that's something you are interested in in the future, you can always reach out to me on here and I can walk you through that process.\n\n\nHopefully this is some good starter information!",

Any other bus you\u2019ll just need to hold up your ISU ID so the driver can see it. I highly recommend taking CyRide or walking anywhere on campus, don\u2019t drive. It\u2019s too congested, nowhere to park. And even if you do find somewhere to park, it\u2019s expensive to pay for. \n\nI believe in freddy court you\u2019ll have to pay for a parking pass to park your car outside your apartment. Not 100% sure on that though. \n\nWill you have a campus meal plan? I don\u2019t think you HAVE to have one in Freddy (you do in the dorms). If you have a campus meal plan, you can eat at the dining centers on campus. The one up in Freddy is called Hawthorn. I guess you can still eat at the dining centers without a meal plan, but it\u2019s expensive so I wouldn\u2019t recommend it. I\u2019d recommend cooking your own food if you have the time and ability. \n\nIn Ames there\u2019s lots of places to go eat or to pick up food from. There\u2019s some on the south side of Lincoln Way, which is called \u201ccampus town\u201d, some on Duff Ave, and some downtown on Main Street. Most of those probably aren\u2019t walkable from Freddy. \n\nPlaces to study: there\u2019s the library, of course. You can pick a random seat or you can reserve a private study room. You can also go into most buildings and if there\u2019s not class going on you can use lecture rooms/halls. I think most buildings are open until 10 pm or so. \n\nFor getting a job: you can check the student job board on AccessPlus or just check out the stores & restaurants around town. Pretty much everywhere is hiring. \n\nNightlife is mostly all the bars on Welch Ave (Campustown area). There are some bars on Main St, but those are less of the college bar type scene. \n\nFor what you should bring during move in: I can\u2019t think of anything special other than your own stuff! I don\u2019t recommend running to target or Walmart the day of move in, it\u2019ll be crazy packed with other students who forgot little things (like command hooks, extension cords, etc). If you can make it a few days without running to the store, I\u2019d try to wait to avoid the craziness. \n\nHope this helps!",

Friendships will form naturally which can form study groups, you can also just ask. Overall it's pretty chill, nothing to stress too much about.\n\nTons of study spots all over campus, there are so many buildings it's hard to even pick a few - check out the library, Howe hall, Coover hall, memorial union. My favorite is the student innovation building - it just feels like a place where you can do your best work, and there's a cafe on the top floor. \n\nCyRide and MyState are pretty simple. Usually have to have your ID ready unless on Gold route I think, that's what I take. I think there are multiple bus routes, and a specific Freddy route to take you to and from campus and within the freddy complex. Seems obvious, but south goes to campus and north goes to you (freddy). As far as the bus stops - one side of the street will always be north and one side will always be south, don't forget that. Google (walking) can get you precisely anywhere on campus.\n\nMy fav spots to eat are The Cafe, Provisions, Taza Mediterranean (#4 is so good), CFA, Five guys, Thai Kitchen, Wasabi. \n\nFor work, that's on you. Not sure how much experience you have, but check the research park for student jobs. They pay very well. Otherwise you can probably find something on campus.\n\nWelcome and good luck!",

Personally I wouldn\u2019t choose the 4 person/2 bedroom because having your own room is the best part about living in an apartment, but also keep in mind that the 4 bedroom rooms are super tiny. The best parts about Freddy are that you don\u2019t have to pay for utilities on top of rent and cyride is super convenient. If you do choose to live there, go for one of the 30\u2019s buildings because they were just remodeled and they\u2019re furthest from the train so you can barely hear it. The worst thing about living at Freddy is probably how expensive rent is compared to off campus apartments especially if you have 3 roommates.

It's so nice having a full kitchen and living room. It was PERFECT for the 2 of us. Probably would have been less enjoyable if there were 4 people. Loved having friends that lived just down the hall. I think I met my CA once? Which I prefer way more than having an RA up in your business constantly.  \nSucked having to pay for a parking permit, and sometimes parking was hard to find and I ended up in the overflow lot across Haber. \nOverall, I loved living there and would absolutely recommend it.",

Some go into computer fields, others research fields, others art fields.\n\nThere's a focus on hyper realism in the curriculum, but you can take more free-form courses and if you have an ambition (I wanted to go into the entertainment industry) then focus on building skills for that.\n\nIts an intense major and im going to be honest, finding a career after requires you to think outside the box and really sell yourself.

Or you could do Art and Design, which is a sister major to ISA, and has a lot more flexibility with it (allowing you to take even more classes geared towards other majors). If you're still unsure about job security / income, I'd reccomend going the graphic design route with a minor in illustration. I'm sure having more options doesn't make it easier, but it's good to know what all is available to you. All in all, stick with what you're passionate about, because a lifetime of doing something you don't care for is gonna suck bigtime.

When I started college, I initially wanted to make art a full-time career by majoring in Industrial Design or Integrated Studio Arts. However, my Dad is a chemical engineer and pushed me to pursue a STEM major.I chose to pursue Mechanical Engineering since there are so many routes and jobs you can do as an ME (including design) for the following reasons:\n\n1. With an engineering degree, you would be able to comfortably afford to do art as a hobby\n2. Your hobby does not become your job, which prevents burnout and ultimately resenting your work\n3. You don't have to get a degree in art to make money off of your art\n\nHowever, any engineering degree takes serious commitment, and you need to be interested in engineering, or you will have a very hard time in your courses. ISU provides many great resources to succeed as an engineer, but you need to put just as much effort into taking advantage of those resources. The ME program and faculty are some of the best the university offers, and I couldn't recommend it enough!   \n\n\nI wish you the best of luck and hope you have a great time at ISU!",

I then took 151 and did pretty well, probably a B+.  When I was in my last semester as a senior, I had a fairly light load, so I thought I try to retake 150 and improve that GPA, especially since I did well in 151.  I retook 150 and got a D- again.  I just couldn't figure it out, but in my mind they were completely different.  Obviously I didn't need to take much from 150 to do well in 151.  Again, this was a long time ago, so things have probably changed.",

The lab for the class was extremely easy! No joke ended with 106%, so no sweat there. I haven't taken gen 320, and I don't know anyone who has. I have never had the professor that is teaching that course either, so I don't have much to say there. \n\nBetween micro 201& 302, if you want the easier course take 201. Micro 201 is meant for students who do not want to pursue medicine later on. It's a much easier class than 302.  As for the lab portion, both sections have the same coordinator, who is an absolute sweetheart. 302 goes into more detail and has more assignments, but it is still reasonable. So, if you're looking for an easier option, 201 is the way to go. \n\nOf all the BBMB courses, 301 and 316 will be the easiest options. I have taken 404, and while it wasn't impossible, it does take a lot of work. I have had a friend who took 420, and they said they didn't enjoy it much at all. I am not totally sure about the difference between 301 and 316, but both are probably around the same difficulty. I have had friends that have taken either or, and none of them have complained about the course.\n\nI hope this helped! If you have any more questions, let me know!",

I've used it for 4 years with an upgrade to the 3060ti in 2021, but I already sold the 1080 I had in it prior.\n\nI checked the prices for PCs with similar specs in Ebay sold and they tend to run at around $1500 at good condition. Only real catch is that it's been pre-loved so there's some wear and tear on the hardware. The only thing broken is the little volume dial on the headset, which I never really use since the keyboard has a volume control. I got a Virtuoso Wireless on black friday sale so I won't need it anymore but it's still a good headset, very powerful and good for FPS. If I have serious buyers I plan on deep cleaning the hardware, but I try my best to keep my peripherals clean.\n\nI'm selling my whole setup for $1500 with Corsair Dark Core RGB Wireless Mouse, K55 RGB Keyboard, Void RGB Wired Headset, and Acer KA240H 1080p 60hz Monitor.

For me what is NOT manageable is when they are spread out throughout the day. One of my semesters MWF was a 10am, 2 hour lab at 2pm, and another 2hour lab at 6pm . So this only allowed 2 hour intervalls which was awful bc i didn't have time to go back to my apartment to make food or chill, or go to gym ( i take 2hr), or really do much besides go to the the library and eat a packed lunch. So that meant i HAVE to be on campus all day. But with this you have all ur classes in the morning to afternoon which it gives u time to either work and study and eat and whatever else. \n\nAlso,I know about 3 weeks in I just slowly stop going to 166. It's a intro class that u just sit and listen. Mine was the only class that day and i fount myself slowly stop going. But it barely has assignments and it has a end of the year \"project\" that's worth half your grade and I remember it's just making your class schedules for the rest of college. It's a pass or fail class so i passed it because of the 50% project.",

The UW school's core had the equivalent of 102 and 131 in the fall semester, and courses building off of each in the spring. Effectively double the studios compared to ISU's core. One studio a semester was cake in comparison. I honestly wished ISU had two studios a semester in their core.\n\nFor further context, I had almost no art experience prior to entering college, and I was able to complete these core programs with plenty of free time while also being a student-athlete. \n\nI'd also HIGHLY recommend sticking with software engineering in some amount. If you can minor in it, do it. If you can't, keep up with it as a hobby. Making REALLY good money in design is difficult, but being a designer that can code is by far the easiest way to do it. Money isn't everything, but holy shit does it help.",

Also if you just don't like germany for some reason, I think there is one of these for most foreign languages, so find a language you like and look for a 378. Also if you have previous foreign language expierence most 300 level courses are arts & humanities, so you can practice your extra languages and get credits for them.",

As long as you meet the GPA requirement and don\u2019t get terrible recommendations you\u2019ll get an interview which usually takes place early spring semester. From there you are either hired for the fall, placed in the hiring pool, or just told they aren\u2019t moving forward with you.\n\nHiring for the spring semester is done purely from the previous hiring pool and RAs that would like to come back from co-ops or study abroad so you won\u2019t be able to be an RA for the spring of 2023, but if you apply now you could get chosen for the fall of 2023!

We're talking crock pots, trays etc. But he'd also complain when I left a cup out.\n\nHis fianc\u00e9 moved in with us about a week into our two year lease, refused to pay any utilities or rent etc. She once got mad and dumped my roommates clothes out of the dryer BEFORE it finished, despite the fact that A she didn't live there, and B would routinely walk into the house at 7pm with a basket full of clothes, start the washer and then leave for a day.\n\nWhile they were living together I heard more than 5 conversations that were essentially her complaining about her degree's workload (I don't remember the degree but its in social services, she was going to work in troubled youth homes) and him saying \"yeah I'm sure you think it's hard but I'm a civil engineer so you can't compare. I'm sure it's still hard, just not hard like my degree.\"\n\nAbout mid May he started getting a lot of packages in the mail, enough that I noticed.

Man was building a proper rifle in our basement and didn't tell us, while we were having weekly arguments that escalated to yelling. I like guns, think they're cool, just crazy he didn't tell us.\n\nMove out time came and he just disappeared, leftovers in the fridge, his clothes in the washer etc. A week later we get a text from him saying \"I'm all moved out, been okay living with you, everything I left behind the new guys are taking!\". Again, bed, socks, trash etc everywhere. Called up the guys moving in (we knew them and referred them) and they said they were expecting a desk and that's it. I took 2 u hauls of his shit to dumpsters around town before being able to load myself up to move out. That sucked.\n\nHis fianc\u00e9 called me the night after I tossed all his shit, two weeks after he disappeared, asking me to let her into the house so she could get some food out of the fridge, then got mad at me for telling her I was in a different state and her food was long gone.\n\nThe really crazy part?

Best of buddies by all indicators. \n\nWell, one day I came home and they were out in the front lawn/common area fist-fighting but instead of using their hands, they were using their PB rackets. Like a serious, all-out fight with PB rackets. It was like the step brothers opening scene and lasted for 15 mins. Like two men sword fighting but actually getting some good cracks in on eachother. Then I watched one of the guys smoke another one in the face and knock him out cold.   \n\n\nThe other guy's girlfriend pulls up and starts screaming \"how could you do this again\" as this shit had happened before??!? It was the most bizarre thing I've ever witnessed in my life and I remember it vividly.   \n\n\nOther neighbors called the cops who came and called the ambulance, the next day one of the kid's moms and dad came, moved all his shit out and I never heard from him again.

I still have her script mostly memorized. She slipped business cards under people\u2019s doors throughout the first semester. Close to winter break she added every dorm resident that she knew into a group chat with her boss to try and recruit them for winter break. I was given most of the complaints, like at least 20 people came to me, and was annoyed myself to be added since I told her I had a job for winter break already. I let her know that she should ask before giving out numbers and her response was \u201cyeah I\u2019ve been getting a lot of complaints too, hmm.\u201d Spring semester she was given a branch in her hometown for the summer and held zoom interviews. Literally every person interviewed was given the job immediately with the classic phrasing \u201cI\u2019ve been giving these interviews for some time now and really know what qualities I\u2019m looking for, and I think that you have all of them so I\u2019d like to offer you the job!\u201d \n\nA couple other smaller things was using my utensils and dishes but never cleaning them until I reminded her multiple times. Getting a boyfriend first night of DIS (which is fine) but they would never leave our room except for classes or to hand in his room. I even befriended his roomate so we could warn each other for escape if they were heading over. But she always went home on the weekends which was a big positive to have the room alone.",

        "body": "My roommate freshmen year was a friend from home. This was in an off campus apartment. He was doing Aerospace Engineering $$$. Trust me when I say that DO NOT think just because you are friends means you can live together. The drama stemmed from his stripper girlfriend he would bring over for 5 days of the week. I had to listen to them pounding for hours at night and it sucked. Basically whenever she was there he would just be fucking, they would eat my food, and never clean up their messes. It got so bad that I called her the S word one night. I promptly got clocked multiple times in the face and had some teeth chipped. It was pretty traumatic and I was shaking for days after that. I'd never genuinely been assaulted like that. He called the police and I went to stay at a friend's house. Anyways,  I found out he basically stopped showing up to class after that and was failing. He dropped out (literally had the audacity to call me to do it for him, i hung up) and went  back to working full time for the military, abandoning his free tuition. Good riddance.  I did have a random roommate during this, but he was a super senior frat bro (Sigma Chi) that acted as a plant the entire time and would just high five him because he was getting laid every night -_-. Once he left, everything was whatever. I basically had the whole place to myself. My mental health improved this year but I still have a hard time trusting military, gym rat, and Greek students.\n\nThe funny thing is once he dropped out at Christmas,  his girlfriend dumped him and he went back home to live with mom. Makes me wonder what his GFs true intentions were.",

If you don\u2019t take it seriously, it\u2019s still an easy A or B.\n\nThe course is fully online and at your own pace. It\u2019s 8 modules (if I remember correctly) and you need to submit a miniature essay over each module, take a module quiz, and submit several short current events essays. Lastly, there is a final test. Most of the questions for quizzes or tests can be found online.\n\nI finished most of the course (8 weeks) in 3 or 4 weeks. The final and some of the tests might have been closed if I\u2019m remembering correctly, but the 8 modules were all open from the beginning which allows you to work ahead on a calm week and pull back on a busy week.\n\nDef can\u2019t see it being everyone\u2019s cup of tea, but it is definitely one of the easiest international perspectives courses with the potential for some killer learning (if you want that). If it makes you feel better about the amount of time required, I took this course during a 19+ credit semester which included O-Chem 2 (front loaded classes for an easier senior year) and managed it fine.\n\nAs a heads up, I took this course 5 or so years ago, so things may have changed.",

As u/john_hascall said, skip the straight to step two. \n3. I do a lot of recruiting for the company I work at and this is what I see. Whether you are CPRE, SE, CS, or MIS, you are applying for the exact same job. I'm not saying this is the same for all companies, but a majority of the companies I see at the Engineering Career Fair I will also see at the Business Career fair. \n\nThese are just my thoughts after completing two COM S classes.

CprE got a fancy nice lab full of SGI boxes (the lab near the Coover front doors), and got to move a bunch of professors into the (then) brand new Durham Center.\n\nComS... got nothing, because they were (and are) under LAS, and Engineering fought to avoid having to share any of the pie.\n\nSince then, ComS has gone out of it's way to be deliberately cold to CprE.  It was REALLY bad in the early 00's, when they'd design their schedule to screw over CprE students as much as they could get away with.  In return, Engineering quietly blackballed ComS students from participating in the C6 project.\n\nNow, if you're actually IN ComS...\n\nThen ComS is a great dept with people who are more genuinely concerned about their students than anyone in Engineering is.\n\nBut Engineering students should always bear in mind... ComS is LAS.  Their faculty despise the faculty in Marston, and Coover, and Durham.  They are obliged to let you into their classes but that's all, and they do not care if you graduate.\n\nIt'll probably be another 10 years at least before the last vestiges of that bad blood are gone, and that's assuming Engineering hasn't continued with their  Scrooge McDuck routine (which they probably have, but I haven't heard any recent stories).",

Here are a few things to check while you are waiting for a response from your advisor: \n1. Check the Current Student Info page on AccessPlus to make sure you don\u2019t have a hold on your account.  If you do, call the phone number listed by the hold next week for more information on how to get it cleared.  This is the likely culprit if you can\u2019t add ANY classes for next semester.\n2. Some sections of classes are reserved for specific populations (usually based on major).  Make sure you aren\u2019t trying to add a reserved section of these classes by checking the Schedule of Classes website. Most restricted classes have a note on the SoC saying who the class is restricted to.  \n3. The classes you are trying to add (Calc II and Physics) have been full off-and-on this week.  Keep checking AccessPlus to see if more seats open. \n4. Reach out to your academic advisor via email for better clarification.  Many advisors are working at least a day or two next week.  If you get an out-of-office email from yours, follow the instructions in that email or reach out to the advising office on Monday to talk to a different advisor that\u2019s available.",

I think they punted on physics, I know they paid absolute shit for the physics profs compared to what they should have gotten.\n\nI am a geneticist, not a physicist, but I looked up the physics profs salaries.",

That means that you will have the *same* homeworks, quizzes, and exams in both classes *at the same time*. You will also have access to additional help resources (e.g. SI, and help hours).\n* So in terms of differences between the two courses, the main thing is that MATH 266 does end a week after the second exam (mid-April) while MATH 267 goes all the way through finals week.\n* In terms of difficulty, differential equations is closest to Calc 2. Namely, lots and lots of algebra and rules and also three major parts of the course which all have a very different flavor. On the other hand there is a standard equation sheet on all exams and quizzes (so a bit less to memorize). And as an added bonus for those taking MATH 267, the final exam is optional.\n* For videos, there are recordings by Steve Butler available (and he keeps toying with the idea of making new ones, if he gets a setup in his underground lair he is happy with). Unfortunately, there are no recordings from Paul Barloon. (At one point in time there also were recordings by Man Basnet, but those seem to have been forgotten.) There will be a fair number of resources available (you can check out [https://www.calc4.org/](https://www.calc4.org/) to get a sense of what already exists).\n\nIf you, or anyone else, has any other questions, let me know and I will do my best to answer.",

Also, is the class structured similarly to the calculus courses (quizzes each week, a \u201ccurve\u201d generated following each exam, etc.) or are they structured very differently?\n\nLastly, what are recommended topics/general concepts from calculus you would recommend someone be familiar with before diving into diff eq? I can confidently say my strong suit is integration (trig integration was -chef\u2019s kiss-. By far my favorite part of calc 2), and can confidently say series were my worst topic. \n\nThanks for all that you\u2019ve done for the math department, all your resources on calc.1/2/3 have helped me a lot!",

The design program as a whole was a great time. Let me know if you have any further questions",

Only ever had one car on campus at a time.\n\nPark my car that is on my permit saturday at 11pm, wake up to an email on Sunday morning saying they noticed my car was in the lot but no window sticker so it was valid for tickets. Went out at 8am on Sunday (9 hours after I parked) to 4 tickets. 4 tickets in 9 hours on a car that is on my permit and has been on campus very often for 7 months. And they even had the gaul to say \"Hey we see you've got a permit but we're going to ticket you anyway.\"\n\nI protested all of them, they refused, wouldn't even let me plead down to failure to display.

I'm unsure what your major is, but if its anything vaguely STEM related, you absolutely want to understand this material very well before moving on. The stuff that comes next only builds on this, and a tower without a solid foundation will not stand the test of time. This is not a class you should aim to cram for and pass, this is a class you should aim to understand.\n\nSteve Butler's videos are extremely helpful ([calc1.org](https://calc1.org)) and without him I would probably have had to retake a class or two. Find what method of note taking works best for you. You will want easy to access, organized notes, you are going to look at these for help and for reference for semesters to come. Even just writing it down can help you internalize the information. Do all the homework and quizzes. Attendance is key. It is really easy to not go to class. The battle for knowledge starts every day with deciding to get out of bed, and often that decision can be a tough one. Go to class, even when you hate it. This next part can be very difficult, but try to do the homeworks before you have only a few hours left. Find a study group. Go to SI. If you are confused about something after class and the Steve Butler videos, google it, there are hundreds if not thousands of people who have explained it time and time again. We live in an unprecedented age of information access, you just have to go looking for it (and leave time to look for it). I'm a junior and I still have to google simple stuff every now and then.\n\nIf it works for you, consider trying a tutor.\n\nDuring the Steve Butler videos, as he says, at least attempt the problem. If you get stuck, unpause, and after he gets past the part you were stuck on, try to continue, and repeat.\n\nHow do I know all of this? Unfortunately, trial and error.\n\nIt is possible that there are even enough points left in the class to pass it even with perfect or near perfect marks. Do not be discouraged by this. It is well worth continuing to go through the class and learning what you can, trying to figure things out and making mistakes now instead of next semester.\n\nI took calc 1 in high school, and I failed the AP exam. That is one of the best things that happened to me. Having to go through calc 1 a second time really solidified my understanding of basic calculus and set me up for success later.\n\nLastly, my number one calculus life hack,\n\nDO THE PRACTICE EXAMS!\n\nIf you can't bring yourself to do that, sometimes setting up a time to go through it with a friend can help you. Setting up a time and a place and getting out of your room, with the added pressure of not wanting to disappoint a friend, can be a very effective study motivator.\n\nThe practice exams are so much help. You get to do a test run, or two or three, of the exams, catching what areas you are weak in, what you have forgotten, and get you in the math mindset so you are less likely to make mistakes on the real deal.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDo not use me as your only sources for this information, but (assuming you know what a derivative is and what a limit is), here is a quick once over of the topics you asked about:\n\nThe four \"rules\" above are about how to take derivatives of various functions. The power rule is for taking the derivative of functions of the form x\\^n. Product rule deals with when you are taking the derivative of two functions multiplied with each other, for example x\\*ln(x). You cannot just take the derivative of x and the derivative of ln(x) and multiply them by each other, you have to use the product rule. The quotient rule deals with taking the derivative of two functions divided by each other, for example x/ln(x).\n\nThe chain rule deals with when you have a function inside of another function, for example ln(x\\^2) or sin(pi\\*x\\^4). Some of the steps to executing the chain rule can be the other rules themselves, so make sure you do those first.\n\nYou will also have to memorize the derivatives of  basic log functions and trig functions, along with basic trig identities. This part sucks and I still have to look them up sometimes.\n\nIntegrals are like the opposite of derivatives. You work through them by doing all of the rules backwards, essentially. However, as the derivative of a constant is zero, derivatives inherently delete information. In the case of an indefinite integral, we don't know if there will be a constant or not, or what it will be, so we add a +C onto the end as a way of saying \"There's something here but we don't know what it is.\" If given an initial condition you can solve for C. For definite integrals, you are evaluating between two bounds so after the actual integration you have to do some algebra.\n\nTaking a derivative is like finding the slope on every point of a function and then plotting those as the y values of a new function. It is essentially the rate of change of a function. For example, the time rate of change of position is velocity, so if you had a function describing your position, you could take the derivative to obtain a function describing your velocity.\n\nThe graphical representation of an integral is summing the area beneath a function. It can also be useful to visualize it as taking every y value on a function and using those as the slope on a new function. If you have a function describing velocity, you can integrate it (with an indefinite integral) to get position (although you would need an initial condition here to get rid of the +C). If you wanted to find the total distance travelled between two arbitrary times, you could use a definite integral. Later on you can do some cool stuff with them to find the volumes of weird shapes.",

I have played on the club team for the last 3 years and am working with the school to be reinstated. As of now it's most likely we will only have a D1 acha team in the near future. The majority of d1 club players have played competitive hockey from very young to about age 20 before they are recruited to play for a college. Open tryouts will happen, but it would frankly be dangerous for someone who doesn't have at least a few years of skating experience to participate. Feel free to pm me with any questions though.",

I *hate* Iowa wind.\n\nThe layers often start with a good baselayer if I'm going to be outside for any length of time.  I'm not too proud to throw on long underwear when it's stupid cold.  It saves ISU the energy cost of running the space heater in my cubicle for nine hours a day.\n\nWaterproof boots are definitely a thing.  Gore-Tex or similar material FTW.  Wool socks (I like Darn Tough and Smartwool), with liner socks inside those if it's really cold or there's a lot of wet snow.  Also, Yak-Trax or similar crampon-type products will be useful once FP&M starts polishing the sidewalk ice.\n\nLiner gloves under heavier ski gloves is a good combo if I need to do anything with manual dexterity.  Stuff the ski gloves in a pocket, keep the liner gloves on, do what I need to do - quickly.\n\n/u/Crazfight is right about masks for breathing comfort - filtering cold/dry winter air through even a single layer of fabric makes a huge difference here.  I have a few shemaghs that I love for being all-in-one breathing + face + ear + neck protection.  They're like the geometric opposite of fashion in most circles but I'm too old to look fashionable anyway, so screw it - I'm gonna look eccentric and avoid frostbite.\n\nLook for good wind resistance in your outer layers (/u/alienatedframe2 mentioned ski/climbing hardshells).  Your cotton hoodie is going to suck for that.  I feel like I'm repeating myself on the wind thing but wind chill is no joke on the frozen-ass prairie hellscape.\n\nJax (local) or REI (West Des Moines) should have staff who can provide pretty good advice on their respective inventories.

This one layer will block an amazingly large amount of wind and cold from ever reaching your skin, especially your legs.\n\nI also have a down North Face alpine parka with a fur-lined hood that comes out any day the temp will be colder than zero, and if the wind chill is low, it comes out then too.  Underneath that hood I wear a beanie over my ears.  Granted, while I feel a bit like a stuffed sausage in my torso when walking wearing the parka, I don't ever feel the cold.\n\nThe other secret of mine is to wear mittens, not gloves in the extreme cold - your fingers can more readily warm one another in mittens, while each finger is isolated in gloves.\n\nFinally, have a good warm set of snow boots on hand for those days when large snow comes or is expected and the crews haven't shoveled yet.  Most other days I'll wear some flavor of hiking boots outside in the winter, and have a pair of dress shoes available at the office.",

I usually wear my regular clothes since the buildings are heated and when I'm outside I use a great coat (like the Soviets used) and an Ushanka hat with faux fur lining and insulation with a detachable face mask that is also lined. If it's really cold I'll wear a second smaller coat or jacket before the overcoat. I also have a thick insulated faux leather jacket with detachable hoodie, everything from Amazon although I've seen Nordstrom rack have pretty good deals with winter wear recently. It's nice as it does well with blocking out the wind. I wear some sweatpants or thermal pants under my trousers or jeans so there is triple insulation and some gloves from Columbia that are very good for their price. I usually wear Timberland boots year round as they are good in any setting. I may look out of place but can safely bet I'm the warmest out of all the people shivering while outside.",

Rent is very cheap for our 4 person 2 bath house @ $450 a month. Oh and there is a private yard and in my case a two car garage + driveway.",

Cyride exists and provides robust service because it literally has to.  In the past 20 years we've built apartments in cornfields while leaving lots in Main Street and Campustown vacant.   The fact that we can build on worthless land at the expense of the city's core neighborhoods is partially enabled by CyRide, just as it is often enabled by induced demand on highways.    It would make no sense to build an apartment complex like The Quarters or The Madison if there was no bus service, considering many students cannot or do not want to drive to campus.   There would also likely be more than (precisely) one place to buy a toothbrush, carton of eggs, or stick of deodorant within walking distance of campus if most students lived in campustown and did not wish to travel elsewhere to accomplish basic errands.   We often make the mistake of presuming mode of transportation is the problem when in reality the problem is the distance traveled.   Yes, there are people in their fifties who prefer to have a yard over living near their workplace or grocery store.   But most students would prefer to live in apartments near campus if given the choice.   I suspect few, if any, live in West Ames because they prefer the location.  Rather, if there's no real incentive for developers to acquire inexpensive property and build high density housing in campustown, low supply will translate to high prices that many of us cannot afford.  I would rather walk to class than drive *or* take a comfortable and punctual bus.  I just have to pick one or the other because I live 2.8 miles away from my classes.",

For example: Would I have LOVED to have taught you Python instead of VBA? Absolutely. Did/do I have the freedom to do that? Nope. \n\nSo much of what you see in your courses is there because of what needs to be demonstrated for accreditation. Changes to curriculum take an incredibly long time, especially if those changes are to a core class. Even when the people teaching you may WANT to do something differently... it's not something that can be implemented quickly...and sometimes not at all.\n\nTeachers in college, unlike every other teacher you've probably ever had, aren't usually trained how to teach. I got lucky and chose to take training but in no way was it required. Someone not answering your questions in the way you want/need definitely sucks, but most of the people teaching you are used to talking to other academics all day every day. Unfortunately, not everyone assigned a teaching role is a great communicator. However, that kind of starts preparing you for industry where not all of your colleagues will communicate in the way in which you're accustomed. There is a lot broken about the system, but I have to agree with other commenters that your rage seems a bit misdirected.",

        "body": "As a senior myself, there are some points I do agree with, but at the same time it\u2019s not all that bad. Let me address a few of your points:\n\n1. You will have some pretty bad professors, but at the same time, I\u2019d say the good professors outnumber the bad ones by quite a bit here. In the last 3 years, I\u2019ve only had maybe 2 really bad experiences as opposed to the dozens of decent experiences I\u2019ve had with professors. \n\n2. I do agree that the lack of unification between different sections can be kind of annoying, but it can be beneficial to people who have different learning styles. For example, I\u2019d personally prefer a section that solves math problems by hand, while others may prefer the section that integrates programming to solve those same problems.\n\n3. I\u2019m not exactly sure if every exam should be open note. If that were the case, I feel like retention of concepts would be way lower, because everyone would just bs their way through classes, which would lead to lower expectations from both professors and future professionals. No one wins in that situation.\n\n4. If you don\u2019t think you\u2019re learning engineering, why not join some projects on campus to supplement your degree. I\u2019ve found that I\u2019ve needed to utilize concepts from several of my classes in the past (particularly aircraft structures, aircraft performance, and flight controls \ud83d\ude05) and it really helps to see how the concepts you\u2019ve learned fit in with real-world applications.\n\n\n\n5. While I do agree that it\u2019s annoying that some of the really cool tech electives aren\u2019t available as much as people would like, you definitely do not need to wait till senior year to do these! Make to Innovate is a class within engineering that directly engages you in university team projects. M2I is something you can do from freshman year and it has no pre reqs.",

Mechanical engineering in particular covers such a wide range of possibilities that it is just not practical to make your BS a tech degree that teaches you the specifics of an industry. Employers accept that, so it  is unclear why OP does not. \n\nWhat employers expect is that you have learned and understood statics, dynamics, heat transfer, strength of materials, etc.  You then use these tools to master your field of engineering in your first few years with a company.  \n\nBut some of OP complaints relate to the sad truth that modern day education is not about education but is about sorting.   Not enough faculty or money to be able to coach every student that wants it through an engineering degree?  Use Weed out classes to drop the numbers down.  Employers want to know who would be the \u201cbest\u201d employees? Assign grades and make sure tests are hard enough that not everyone will pass.  If they took the time and resources to ensure everyone completely mastered all the material and all got As, how would employers easily sort brand new graduates?",

        "body": "Made this throwaway to respond to this post. Some thoughts:\n\nI agree that the quality of education at Iowa State University is extremely low. For reference, I graduated with a computer engineering degree a few years ago. I had a 3.9 GPA and now work for a FAANG as a software engineer.\n\nI find the basis of your points to be valid and incredibly relatable. I think the negative response you are receiving is from the somewhat brash way the post was written (but I completely understand the frustration).\n\n**Some of my many anecdotes:**\n\n* Multiple classes had a large amount of low quality busy work that put undue stress onto students without providing value. \n   * I regularly worked on schoolwork from 9am - 2am (\\~ 3 times a week) with breaks only for meals. As you can imagine, this took a huge toll on my mental and physical health.\n   * Some courses would vary **wildly** in their workload depending on which professor you had / semester you took the course. Though they show up on your transcript the same.\n* Some professors were not qualified to teach courses.\n   * On family weekend, my mother asked to sit in on one of my lectures in a hall of 100+ students. We sat in the back of the room and ended up walking out of the class that day. The professor spent the entire first 30+ minutes talking about cockroaches and playing around with the feedback loop the mic and speakers made. This same professor was also known to yell at students during office hours. Just bizarre. My mom was baffled that the quality of some courses could actually be that bad.\n   * One of my professors did not grade **anything** for months. When midterm grades were due for eligibility, he entered \"estimates\". I regularly voiced my frustration with this, as we couldn't gauge our standing in the course or learn from our mistakes on quizzes or tests. His response was \"It shouldn't matter to you this much unless you plan on attending an Ivy for graduate school or getting into a top company after you graduate.\" Wild.\n   * Multiple professors would use slides from other institutions and then teach them *incorrectly.* \n      * One professor used slides from UC Berkeley. I had a friend taking Com Sci courses at UC Berkeley under the professor that made the slides, and would chat with him regularly. The amount of mistakes the ISU professor made when mis-teaching the slides was almost comical.\n* As you mentioned, Engineering advisors do legitimately suggest to their students to take Physics courses at other universities / community colleges and transfer the credits in. That should be a huge red flag for the school.\n\n**What I did:**\n\n* I *did* go to Thielen to discuss my concerns. The physician I saw all four years was actually shocked to hear my accounts and see my emails with professors. Her response was essentially: I can't believe this is happening, I am really disappointed with the school.\n* I spoke with multiple of ISU on campus counselors:\n   * I always suggest going to therapy, ISU's counselors are hit or miss as they set you up with students. Regardless, counseling could not fix issues like the lack of sleep courses would continue to require etc.\n* I brought my concerns to the head of the department with a group of students that felt the same way, the department head blew them off. I then escalated my concerns to the dean of engineering and had a one on one meeting in his office. He seemed genuinely concerned and discussed ways he would follow up. Of course no follow ups occurred.\n* I applied to transfer (only a single year before I was set to graduate). I was not accepted to the school as the counselor said I had too many credits. I should of applied to more institutions, but I was trying to do too much at once.\n* By the end, I was honestly too burnt out to continue pursuing the issue. It felt like I was trying to fix a school that did not care about me. My goal was to prevent future students from going through the same problems I did, but I honestly became too beat down from the process. I would guess that there were students before me with similar results that also were unable to make a change.\n\n**Summary thoughts:**\n\n* The negative experiences I faced were specific to the courses I took and professors I had. I also took a large amount of business courses where I had a quite pleasant experience. I would guess that many ISU students do not face the challenges mentioned above. \n* In my opinion, ISU's quality of education is very poor (at least for computer engineering). But, I would *guess* it is on par with some other state school's and small schools not known for their academics. This does not excuse ISU's problems.\n   * When directly comparing educational experiences / homework / course materials with my peers at institutions better known for academic rigor, it was abundantly clear that ISU is behind the mark.\n* I think there are more students feeling this way than you would expect, and I hope that someday students those students are able to come together to make real change.\n\nI have much more to say about ISU, but do not have the time to type it all out. Just know you aren't alone in these thoughts, best of luck with your next steps and future :)",

        "body": "I would love too. First of all, cut all English and general education classes. Across the board, none of those belong unless it's relevant to the major. High school is to round you out, college should be specialized. See, I don't have much a problem going through calc1-3 and diff eq, nor the physics, my problem is 2 things. 1 the unbelievably shitty and incompetent professors I've had for those early big lecture classes. 2 the assigned work is just so blatantly busy work. It's not a question of if you are smart enough, it's a question of are you willing to blindly follow orders like the military. Additionally, all the calculus hw had next to nothing to do with what we were learning. If you don't believe that, I encourage you to ask around. \nNow that more class slots are open, we should be exposed to a lot more engineering. We should have lab classes like ME 324L year 1! You do not need to know theory to get through that course. I want the 50/50 hands on they said I would have in my tour. \nFinally, give us the goddamn choice for our education. To graduate you need 15 credits of technical electives. There are  15 classes I want to take. As in, if I had the time in my schedule I would take it instead of do nothing. Yet here I am, junior year and it's my first tech elective and I'm early. The thing about these classes is they are actually relevant, they actually apply to the world. Take ME 444 -Elements of Power Plants. This takes thermo 1 and 2 concepts and applies them to real and potentially future power systems. ME 410 and ME 418 both robotics which are a massive part of ME. I can go on. My particular anger is these classes are in the catalogue and most either not offered or not even close to enough sections for the demand and, following ME 4 year plan, you only have 2 semesters to get in. If your RAN sucks, well sucks to suck. You just suffered through years to hopefully be able to apply all this mass of knowledge to something real and maybe for once, something you actually enjoy, and it's like riding a minecraft pig with a carrot, the classes are in the catalogue, but not offered. \n\nTo sum this, I really want applications. Get me out of the classroom, get me learning about real life. Nothing about school is real life",

I don't give a flying fuck if engineers dont usually work with their hands or get down on the floor with the floor workers, but they have great insights.

Are they supposed to rail on and on about it, knowing it's unfixable? Or rather, just accept that this is reality? There are often so many factors that play into even the most miniscule of changes, which effectively impede any action. Say you want to make an update to an online form that your own office controls. Well, what does this form do? Do other offices interact with this form? Do they need to be consulted? Okay, you make the change; does this need to be run up the system? Does a Dept. Chair need to sign off? Who handles the processing part? Will this add to their workload? Have they been trained? Have you addressed all potential pitfalls, because people are always getting confused? Getting it online; who handles that? Okay, so its online and active... what happens when people submit the old version? Will you still process it? Will you force them to redo it? Was this change advertised on Inside Iowa State email blasts? Do all the hyperlinks work? How long will you allow old versions to be submitted, since people regularly save local copies to their HD?  \n\n\nLiterally all these questions have to be answered, about a simple change of a form within your own office/department. Now, imagine if any changes require the use of new tools or checklists. Was the change an internal process, or was it a policy change? Because the latter needs to run through Faculty Senate. Do any of the changes have legal impacts? Was University Counsel consulted?  \n\n\nWhat you're railing about is **systematic** problems- the whole university and higher education system writ-large. I've gone through the process of making small, local, changes before and it's a legitimate fucking TASK which requires a long damn time coupled with copious amounts patience. You don't get to just wave your dick like a wand and make the change you so desire, not within a bureaucracy. That's even harder when said bureaucracy is one within a multitude of bureaucracies; all who have their own issues, agendas, ideas, and rationales for doing what they do.",

There is no escape now with technology. I'm blaming each and everyone of us, not the top, for giving up, for accepting our misery. I won't live to be your age if nothing changes, I won't accept this miserable, terrible, horrible, world. Maybe you can go on everyday hating your life and being miserable thinking about what could have been, but I just can't. I cannot do that. No one will believe me, but I've been talking about this stuff since even middle school. We all know the problems. Nothing changes. We failed as hunanity. Can you not see how this leads to our end? I can and will ask it again 'why are you all so complacently miserable'",

Shits fucked up and its probably going to get more fucked up. I've come to terms with that and I'm going to weather it to the best of my abilities. It might get bad, but that's why we have to enjoy life now. I don't support the shit that AA propagates, but they do have a very good prayer (fwiw, I'm agnostic): \"Lord grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, courage to change the things I can, and wisdom to know the difference.\" That shit is profound, because the last aspect is something that typically only comes with age.  \n\n\nIf you want something a bit more philosophically concrete, look into Stoicism. Marcus Aurelius knew what he was doing when he practiced that stuff. At the end of the day, you have power over yourself, the choices you make, and your response to events. You can lash out with a barbaric yawp against a system you perceive to be unjust/illogical, but that's not going to get you far. Seriously, look into Stoicism before you degrade into a quarter life crisis. Also, for fucks sake... go be young. Enjoy it! I'm not far removed (dude, I was BORN in the 80s) considering I'm a Millennial. Even in the crises of graduating during the Great Recession (oofta), I can still look back to those days with fondness. There wasn't much to look forward to back then either, from what I knew.   \nAlso, barring an unanticipated health event, you're gonna make it into your late 30s.  \n\n\nGo join a club. Play some video games. Drink shit beer with your friends. And also... go get laid. It sounds like you could stand to get the matter off the mind.",

Iowa State has a pretty great architecture program in the sense that you are well equipped for a job after graduation. I\u2019m sure some would disagree, but Iowa State has made a good reputation in firms. The five years are long, but the accreditation makes it worth it.\n\nStudio culture is strong by the looks of it. No matter what time of the day, you\u2019ll find a consistent group working in studio. There\u2019s a great social environment and many people willing to give you critiques on work. Once you are in the program (after your first year) you get your own desk, so studio becomes convenient for working on anything you don\u2019t want to bring back to your dorm/apartment everyday. I personally find studio culture to be best when a major review is coming up and there\u2019s a massive group of people working on projects late into the night. \n\nProfessors are fantastic as well. There\u2019s a few that will certainly rub you the wrong way, but there\u2019s something to learn from all of them. You call all of them by their first name and keep conversations casual. I\u2019ve had some great conversations with professors since being here, and that\u2019s made a great impact on my learning. They are all happy to be at ISU and greatly interested in their research and helping students. Hope this helps!",

Studio kinda dominates your life and takes priority over everything, including other classes, which is probably the easiest gripe with it.

There\u2019s programs specifically made to address the diversity on campus (such as the **BUILD learning community** which I recommend a lot as a design student if you\u2019re BIPOC and/or apart of the LGBTQ+ community), and also **APEX** for multicultural students, which starts before the summer of your first Fall semester. (Highly recommend since you get to take free college courses in the summer/free overall, explore different places and activities related to your college, research opportunities, explore resources, and do fun events all throughout it. The community I made from there are my friends till this day and made transitioning to college easier knowing that I wasn\u2019t alone within a PWI. You also get to move in for the Fall semester during the first week of August which was nice).\n\nThere\u2019s a good amount of opportunities to meet other minorities on campus through organizations, events, clubs, and generally everywhere. A lot of events and organizations do address and have intersectional identities if you\u2019re apart of more than just one marginalized community.\n\nHowever, since starting my freshmen year in the summer, I and some of my friends have encountered racism already. :/ \n\nSome of our experiences relates to college students yelling out slurs towards us while they are driving, and when we are isolated or with family. The second time my race was a factor, was this week studying in my hall\u2019s den. There was a group of other students pressuring each other to say the hard r when I was the only black person there when just casually studying alone. There are also incidents were it\u2019s clear you\u2019re the sole minority involved, but that\u2019s universal unfortunately.\n\nDespite what\u2019s listed above, I think it\u2019s manageable since I do have friends who are also BIPOC, and that it makes up a very small percentage of my great experience at ISU so far. A lot of professors and faculty do genuinely care about these issues and educating students of them accordingly. \n\nI would also point out that for Architecture and Landscape Architecture, you\u2019ll definitely have more opportunities available in the COD when it\u2019s one of the most popular majors there are, in addition to Graphic Design and Industrial Design. Those are the main majors ISU gives attention towards at the COD, even though each design/art major has a wide set of support and great professors. \n\nLastly, I think that if you\u2019re in **Science Bound,** that the scholarship will cover Architecture, Landscape Architecture, and Industrial Design since they recently consider those STEM majors. There could be more for the COD, but this is what I heard from friends involved in it at the COD.",

It also has a much bigger final project- and when I took it, you had to have a certain part of it done to turn in every week, instead of all at the end. The lectures are pretty basic in both classes. Dan Brabec is a great professor, and I'm sure you'd have fun in either class!\n\nI've also heard HORT 121 (Home Horticulture) is fun, but I haven't taken it myself.",

However, if it\u2019s a popular property that lots of people want to live at, and there aren\u2019t a lot of apartments at your site, it\u2019s possible this is legit. Despite enrollment being down, places in Ames are filling quicker than ever, which is odd, but that\u2019s the way the market is right now. For example, at my property, we are offering renewals right now but our deadline to renew isn\u2019t until end of January, but it\u2019s a pretty large property. If yours is small I can understand why they need to know who\u2019s staying, but also if it\u2019s small it seems incredibly early to try to get you to renew.

If you end up deciding that you\u2019ll be staying in the area / don\u2019t want to move / staying at your current apartment is the best choice for you, I wouldn\u2019t wait any longer than necessary to lock in that renewal. If they\u2019re telling the truth and plan to fill quickly, best to lock in your spot and get the best rate that they plan to offer.\n\nAnother tip, OP, would be to go into the leasing office and talk with a manager or leasing agent about your concerns with renewing this early. If they know you\u2019re interested but are on the fence, they\u2019ll be more likely to hold off on filling your spot in the hopes that you\u2019ll renew and it will ne less work for them to move someone new in. You may, however, get reached out to more frequently by them asking if you\u2019ve given any further thought to renewing, haha! \n\nAt the end of the day, I always tell my residents to make the decision that\u2019s best for them. You\u2019d probably feel better signing later on for a higher rate than signing early just for a cheaper rate and being stuck in the lease in the event you want / need to get out. Just keep in mind that the deadlines that are there are set for a reason, but they\u2019d more than likely be willing to work with you on a timeline - they\u2019d rather keep you than lose you!",

Inflation has gone through the roof and in an effort to curb it the Fed has raised the interest rates a lot making it more expensive to borrow money. 1 year ago a house in my neighborhood wouldn't last 2 weeks on the market, some less than 24 hours, we now have a couple houses in our neighborhood that have been on the market for months without any movement. This also feeds the cost of apartment leases so if you aknow you want to stay and they are offering attractive rent, take it. Property taxes will be going up (because the value of property jumped the last 2 years), employees cost more because you need higher wages to keep them, and if the loan rate on the apartment is variable the cost of that will go up as well, not to mention the cost of maintenance items (replacement parts) have gone up as well.",

That's my advice for every event poster you see on campus afterwards as well; make that tuition money work for you and take part in everything you can. Generally before coming here I wish someone told me how centralized the social scene is. If you want to know a lot of hot people who know how to party you should join a sorority or frat. I almost regret it in my senior year; I despise the culture associated with being in a fraternity so I never did it. I never thought I would chase the party scene either but here we are. If that's something important to you, go to UofI lol. Their girls are better and the city life is incredible, plus, my roommate tells me the person who did the city planning for Iowa City is the same person that did Boulder, Colorado.

You get to visit each house and get to know the people in it and find the best fit for you. I know this is going to sound lame asl and super cheesy but joining a frat is one of the best decisions ive made in my life. It was so easy to come out of my shell and meet people in the greek community when I joined freshman year. Also being able to apply myself through positions I've held and give back to the community is super fulfilling. Greek life gets shit on a lot because of all the stereotypes but ISU Greek life is one of the best greek communities in the nation (we get awards for it lol) so you know that if you join a fraternity/sorority here it's going to be a great place to grow socially and scholastically. There are so many opportunities to get involved and the resume boost doesn't hurt either. Getting involved with the greek community or joining a club is probably one of the easiest ways to meet people and make friends but there's so much more to greek life than just partying that it's at least worth trying. One of those \"don't knock it til you try it\" situations.",

(As not everyone in the COD has history with drawing or not having previous opportunities to take art and design courses). It\u2019s also required for a lot of prerequisites for most design and art majors/minors.\n\nI have it with Amy Harris and she is very sweet, while making sure she gives each student specific advice to fit their circumstances and skills. I heard a bit of horror stories with other professors being more strict, but overall I enjoy this class! Each professor also does completely different projects from one another, or bounce off their ideas while changing it accordingly to what they prefer.\n\nYou will definitely spend a lot of time outside of class to work on projects, so keep that in mind if you want to add this course; though there will be time provided in class to work on them too! (Usually when we are in an active project, I\u2019ll spend around 6-8 hours outside of it on just the project alone from start to finish).\n\nI should also inform you that there are online lecture videos (usually two-three 44 minutes ones a week) and a free textbook online to read, and admittedly I\u2019m not too caught on either, but are important for the exams; which make up 20% of the grade. \n\nI think the ability to just draw and give feedback while making friends with others in a studio makes it relaxing regardless. It\u2019s the smallest class I have, but I love it for that. (Around 20ish students).",

The course is basically designed to teach people who have never drawn, the fundamentals of drawing (focuses on pencil, with some colored pencil and copics). It's not super creativity focused, as much as it is focused on the technical side. The course is definitely made to develop the sketching and construction skills of students going into design majors. Learning how to draw quickly, proportionally, and accurately. \n\nBe warned tho; the class is a pretty damn heavy workload. Drawings take a lot of time, and you kinda have to go out of your way to do them, since most of them will be in-studio still lives, or environments or whatnot. Almost none of your projects will get close to done in class. There's a reason the design building is the only building on campus open 24/7 lol\n\nI just spent about 60 hours on one project. I had three weeks to do it, but it was still hard to get it all in, even doing multiple hour days. I skipped a class and drew for 13 hours straight to try and finish before the deadline. I wasn't even procrastinating beforehand \ud83d\ude02\n\nYou will also have to buy a lot of art supplies to do this singular class, which can get pretty damn expensive. The book is cheap compared to other classes, but the supplies are definitely not. Most students in the class are design students, so we'll use the supplies eventually, but it may be different if this is the only time you do art lol. \n\nThey can go on your U-Bill if you buy them through the bookstore, but the bookstore doesn't always have great stock, and they can be slow if you order online.",

You HAVE to work on it every single day or you'll fall behind. I kept a tally of the hours I spent on every project and spent 50+ hours on one over about 3 weeks. Apart from the stress of the workload, I did enjoy it and found it relaxing to be able to kind of tune out and sit and draw for a few hours--I listened to a lot of audiobooks that semester. And it was really fun to look back at the progress I'd made since the beginning of the semester.\n\nAlso, be aware that drawing supplies are expensive. Iirc I spent around $200 on supplies and haven't touched them since the end of that semester, but if you're hoping to get into drawing as a hobby you'll probably get good use out of them after the class is finished.",

It's talking to professors, asking for help from TA's. Reading up and brushing up on the material. The best students spend time outside of class and lab. Most freshmen think if they attend class and just show up they'll get an A. Unfortunately that's far from it especially in engineering. \n\nIf you are spending time outside of class trying to figure it out, but to no avail. I would continue to stick it out, keep asking questions, go to office hours.

Figure out where your classes are before classes begin. Like, go in the buildings and find the specific room.  \n4. The third floor of Parks Library often smells like fart (or it did a decade+ ago).  \n5. Show up to class and ask questions. If you show you're engaged, an 89% at the end of the year can \"magically\" become a 90%.   \n6. Pay attention when crossing the street and observe the walk/don't walk signs. Your phone can wait and those CyRide buses can't exactly stop on a dime when the roads are slick.   \n7. Three Advil, a large Gatorade, eggs, bacon, & toast will usually cure a hangover.   \n8. If you can, work part-time. No one's above doing Charlie work and whatever you make will help reduce the amount of loans you'll need to take out.  \n9. Always be on the hunt for a nice, clean, pooping bathroom. You'll want to know of one nearby if a turtle head is poking out. Nothing worse than having to hover because the previous dude couldn't aim his pecker and pissed all over the seat.  \n10. Fuck the Hawks.",

It\u2019s not necessarily too challenging, but many freshman classes are \u201cweed out\u201d classes so if you don\u2019t stay on top of it, you can easily fall behind. As a more specific piece of advice, I would recommend to have some coding knowledge going into it. A lot of the intro programming classes that CprE/CybE/SE have to take kind of assume you already know some stuff. Other than that, any habits you formed in high school should really stick. Also, don\u2019t hesitate to contact a professor or TA with any problems you have. Most professors I\u2019ve had are very lenient and even though the syllabus may say they don\u2019t do stuff like accept late work, a polite email explaining your situation can do wonders. It\u2019s worked for me many times. \n\nAnd one last thing, most classes don\u2019t require attendance so it\u2019s really easy to skip class here and there. Just make sure you go to class, most of my stresses are due to me skipping class and falling behind.",

Look around for any sort of day job thats tech related your first summer.\n   * Good places for easier to get internships are large midwest companies, defense contractors, healthcare/insurance, or the hundreds of government agencies / DOD\n   * Once you have a first engineering internship try to get your next one at a large tech company / trading firm. The pay / benefits are literally multiples more of other companies\n* The ISU career fair is really not that great for CS/related majors. Look elsewhere for internships + getting paid to live in a different city for a summer is a blast\n* Make friends in your classes. Especially anything involving operating systems, architecture, or discrete mathmatics\n* Go to the gym / work out at least 3x a week. You're gonna be sitting down a lot doing homework so you need to get some exercise\n* Learn how to drink properly and find fun people to do it with. You can usually catch me at the bars once /twice a week. Fake IDs are usefull but police have been cracking down hard in Ames lately\n   * Sams Club vodka is 14.99 /handle and is better than whatever else you're going to drink as a freshman\n* Start learning personal finances **now.** Credit scores, bank accounts, IRAs/401k, insurance premiums, taxes, credit card rewards, etc.\n* You can have a healthy balance of both partying / fun and being a decent student.

If the cherry eye isn't causing problems now you might be able to wait a bit for a less expensive option.",

I can recommend a few readings on fascism if you'd like. \"Ur-Fascism\" is a popular one. Leon Trotsky also has a series of works on fascism that have been collected and edited into the volume \"Fascism: What it is and How to Fight it.\" Also, Clara Zetkin was a German socialist who lived in the early 1900s and wrote a report outlining fascism's characteristics entitled \"The Struggle Against Fascism.\" Finally, there's a book called \"The Origins of Totalitarianism\" by Hannah Arendt that details the rise of Stalin and Hitler and discusses the 20th century emergence of Totalitarian regimes. If you are serious about anti-fascist or anti-authoritarian activity, I highly recommend these works.",

Fascism has only emerged (to my knowledge) organically in three places: Italy, Spain, and Germany. Some might add Japan to this list, but I do not know enough on Japan's history to speak authoritatively on the subject. Likewise, some places saw Fascism inorganically created. For example, France was fascist for a time, but this was because it was imposed by the German government. Fasicsm is less of a specific ideology and more of a political emergence caused by crises that cannot (or will not) be solved through traditional liberalism and within places that have no powerful enough left-wing opposition to stop it. \n\nWhile I would agree with you that what China is doing to Uighur Muslims is awful, that doesn't make it fascism by default. This is what I was getting at with my statement regarding the word being overused and misunderstood. Often we use fascism to denote an authoritarian state doing bad stuff, but fascism is a significantly more complex reality that needs to be understood more concretely if we seek to practice true anti-fascism. I worry that fascism is coming back, and being able to recognize the roots may be the key towards preventing its eventual march towards power. \n\nAgain, I would like to be reiterate that it is important to criticize China, especially regarding the ongoing Uighur genocide, but we need to understand that fascism is more than committing genocide. This is important for critiquing the realities of both fascism and China, and for cultivating an effective resistances to these forces.",

        "body": "Generally, yes, the most effective way to resist fascism and authoritarianism is through violent noncompliance or overthrow of regime. Authoritarianism is a less specific term, and could refer to all sorts of societies (including American society) and thus has many different currents that can be countered in nonviolent ways (though it should be noted that violence underlies all politics). \n\nI'm not a Chinese specialist, and I would like to clarify that I am not super familiar with Chinese history. I know a fair bit, and I try to stay up to date on their current politics, but it is difficult to get a complete picture when our media is colored by anti-Chinese propaganda and without speaking the langauge. I do believe that China is engaging in a genocide of the Uighur people and I do believe that China is an authoritarian state. I believe you are correct when you stated that Chinese nationalists are a growing threat and that China is undergoing an economic recession (as we are globally). Still, I feel that there are quite a few important differences that are easily identifiable.\n\nThe Chinese state appears to be managing the current crisis without collapsing and hasn't been destroyed or replaced yet. There may be hardship, but I haven't seen any populist right wing movements that have taken power. I have not heard of mass mob violence occurring in China recently, though I did hear of one example in Hong Kong of mafia-related mob violence committed against pro-democracy protesters in 2018. China is anti-worker for sure, but they incorporate unions into the state rather than suppress them wholly. \n\nThese differences may seem small, but they make a lot of difference when it comes to questions of resistance. Resisting fascism usually means resisting the populist right (not the state) that emerges out of a crisis and perhaps a NEW state later if they're successful. Resisting the Chinese brand of authoritianism means resisting the state as it exists (and probably organizing with populists to do so). The prevelance of mob violence in a system determines who you have to fight: the police or your neighbors or both. Who you must fight also determines how you are able to fight, if at all. The function of unions changes here too. Unions are a powerful tool for cultivating anti-fascist activity, but in China the unions are just one more aspect of the Chinese state that actively serve in its interests. \n\nAgain, to reiterate my point, its important to understand what fascism is so it can be fought correctly and effectively. Similarly, it is important to understand China so we can fight it well. I don't think that the current Chinese state has undergone the same transformations Germany, Italy, or Spain did in the mid-twentieth century. Perhaps I am wrong, and perhaps you could provide me more information about groups like the Pinkies and how they function in China or the economic crisis that you believe is sufficiently devastating to have created the conditions for fascism. Fascism is a more complex topic than I laid out in my original comment, and the  rise of fascist regimes is (so far) a unique outgrowth of the 20th century depression. I do worry that fascism may rear it's ugly head again soon, but it's also possible that contemporary authoritarianism is something else entirely that is evolving past fascism into something potentially more terrifying.",

Their \u201csocial stability\u201d spending exceeds the military spending every year since 2014 (?). As the only party in town, the CCP is a right wing movement, they control the media put out anti-west propaganda, threatening Taiwan to keep people allied up. It\u2019s hard to define mob violence in a mob state, where the police, military, armed police, secret police, now Dabai are doing the mob violence daily. \nChinese people are not allowed to create their own union, the state appointed union is the only union, otherwise - jail. \nThe Chinese people don\u2019t have access to internet, their activities is limited to few apps that are being monitored every second, so all the union thing, you will be arrested, even trying to start a club, you could be arrested. This is what the Chinese government particularly good at is to ionize the society, making people not trusting each other let alone start a political movement. \nI too worried about fascism in America, but I think the liberal bias of you being uncomfortable of talking about Chinese politics is clear because of fear of being labeled as racist (common techniques used by the pinkies). I was expecting way more from you since you are in the forefront of Sociology, you should not be fear about getting cancelled because of your opinion of an authoritarian states. If you are interested in study pinkies, r/newswithjingjing r/sino would be a good start.\n\nI would also advise you not to consider the American reporting of China as biased. They are mild compared to most of my Chinese sources",

        "body": "I assure you I am not afraid of being labeled a racist nor of being cancelled for discussing Chinese politics (especially on reddit), and I don't think that you understand that I am also critiquing China and stating that it is an authoritian state. Nothing that you've stated here contradicts the inconsistencies in the fascist movements of the 1900s to the Chinese state today that I pointed out in my last comment. \n\nI mentioned that the union in China is a tool of the state, which you also emphasized. In the 1900s, Unions were organizing against fascism until they were destroyed completely. This underlines a difference in tactics one can use in resistance. Unions were weapon against fascism, but are a weapon OF Chinese authoritarianism.\n\nMob violence refers to violence that is committed by groups of people who are explicitly NOT directed or linked to the state. As far as I can tell, the groups you mentioned (aside from tankies and pinkies, but you've only mentioned them as a canceling force not as a violent mob) are all state operated and directed. This is not mob violence, though it does demonstrate many of the police state qualities that fascist regimes did use, it isn't angry bigots on the streets busting up people as a mob. This isn't to say that individual hate crimes don't happen, I'm sure they do, but an individual committing a hate crime is different than a mob mass lynching. Can you point to examples of violent political organizations that are not affiliated with the state that are actively committing violence against Uighurs or other minority groups? \n\nAtomizing individuals is a common tactic in authoritarian and totalitarian states. It was used in Nazi Germany, it was used in Stalinist Russia, and it is is now being used in China. This tactic isn't specifically fascist though, it is rather an aspect of  authoritianism more broadly.\n\nAgain, I am not uncomfortable discussing Chinese politics. Rather, I am cautious about my understanding of Chinese politics seeing as how I have never lived in China nor have I spent a great deal of time studying it. Your point that I am influenced by my existence in western liberal society is true, but your premise that I am scared of being labeled a racist is wrong. I am actively critiquing China, labeling them authoritian, and arguing that they are committing a genocide. None of this would come from a China apologist. I merely disagree with the idea that modern day China exists as the same social phenomenon as fascism as it has been oberserved.",
