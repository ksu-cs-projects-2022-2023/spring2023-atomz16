Lubbock will be cheaper than areas around those schools, but you're also looking at more of a \"small town\" atmosphere.

Produces really good business and finance candidates. Or also say has a good fine arts program that has an excellent post placement. Decent scholarships. \nAs for those who say weird looks, it\u2019s college, get over it. Everyone is weird including the frats and jocks. Tech is a very social atmosphere. Part of its strength actually. You\u2019re going to find people you can associate with there on so many areas. \nIt has its down sides like any school. Will it fulfill your needs to what you want to achieve?",

I also got my bachelors in math from Tech, so that could have given me an edge on acceptance to the program, but I doubt you\u2019d have a hard time with a good GRE score and good overall GPA from undergrad. To be honest I don\u2019t know what the actual acceptance rate is. \n\nI\u2019m not sure about going from Comp Sci to math since graduate school is pretty proof heavy. Did you take any sort of Advanced Calculus or proof based math class in undergrad? I know Intro to Real Analysis ate my lunch my first semester, but I got the hang of it the second time around. It\u2019s doable, but plenty difficult!\n\nI was also a TA/Graduate Part Time Instructor while I finished my degree which is a great way to build a good study group with my peers since i was always there and reduce the cost. If you have any interest in teaching, this would also be great experience. I graduated and went straight to an adjunct teaching job for a community college. TA reduces tuition and also gives a $15-20k (9 months) stipend. I know PhD students get even more. \n\nI know a lot of people hate on Lubbock, but I\u2019ve lived in the area all my life and I love it. People are nice, it\u2019s not toooo crowed like DFW, cost of living is low, and sometimes the weather is nice hehe. \n\nI don\u2019t know if any of that is helpful, but if you have any questions let me know!",

It\u2019ll be over the subject you want to get your certification in with some teaching theory questions thrown in.  Pretty sure they\u2019re just released certification tests.  \n\n\nI\u2019m not aware of a 1 year program, I was a History major, secondary education minor, which required a 2 year program.   Education majors was a 3 I believe.  \n\n\nFor the minor program your first year becomes available when you get junior hours on a block schedule.  I.e. you have to start in the fall or wait another year. \n\n\nFirst year is just 2-3 classes a semester while you finish your major.  I took my last major/ basic courses the year before I graduated.  \n\n\nSecond year 1st semester is 3-4 education classes and anything you have left over from basics/major.   And only student teaching one day a week. \n\n\nSecond year 2nd semester is full time, in the classroom every day, hopefully you should have all your other classes done by then. Full time student teaching was hit and miss from my friends. My mentor was pretty relaxed and I just helped him. I\u2019d make the lesson for like one day a week and teach 1-2 classes a day. And like I said just generally helped day to day classroom stuff. \n\n\nWhat subject and grade level are you considering?",

I don't know why Tech offers that business degree; it's basically a data analyst degree. Data science requires rigorous mathematics, almost always at the Ph.D. level. It's impossible to extrapolate knowledge from data without a rigorous and lengthy stats background. Whenever you apply for a ds position, you'll be competing with Ph.D. graduates. If you want to pursue ds, you would want to do a master's in statistics and eventually your Ph.D. However, you can get by with getting some entry-level data analyst position with an undergraduate in mathematics, comp sci, or physics, depending on your resume of course.",

Depending on your major, it may or may not be a good financial decision to go to a community college.  Some posters have pointed out that the merit-based scholarships are a bit more generous for incoming students than transfer students, but Tech still does have good merit-based scholarships for CC transfers.\n\nThe big thing you need to think about is whether you might be able to graduate in 4 years if you come straight to Tech, versus maybe needing an extra year if you transfer in.  If you're in a major with a lot of sequential requirements (like a lot of STEM programs), you might transfer in with all your general education done, but without some of the sophomore-level courses you need for your major.  In a lot of STEM majors, you will struggle to make up those classes in summers, because they might just not be offered in summers.  What you'll end up with is three years taking 12 credits a semester.  In certain other majors, it may be no problem at all to finish in 2+2, and you might find the personal attention better at a community college where the classes tend to be smaller than the intro classes at Tech.",

The current limit is 4 students per tutor to avoid overwhelming the tutor. You clock in a set times every week and wait for a student to come to your table. Note that the work times are the same every week, so as long as you give them your school and extracurricular schedules, work will not interfere with school often. \n\nI don't do any SI, but from what I know is that SI leaders are more like teachers in that they make lesson plans and present it to a group of students interested at a scheduled time. \n\nPersonally, I feel like tutoring is more my style since I love helping students out and I'm always happy seeing them get over the hump. It feels much more personal and interactive to me from a tutor standpoint. But I'm sure SI leaders have their benefits.",

If it's with the school (Learning center,  Student Housing, etc) they're generally very flexible, often you have some room to choose your own hours above a certain limit. I don't know about pay since it probably depends on who you're working for but usually they're between $10-12/hr, but it might be worth asking whoever contacted you  or someone in that service. \n\nAFAIK SI leader jobs are a little less flexible. Hopefully someone else comments who's been an SI leader, if not you can probably contact someone in charge or some good ol fashioned googling. Ultimately both are very different jobs",

I literally can\u2019t stress enough how bullshit all tours are. We toured The Bloc for example and thought it was great and almost ended up signing there. We asked around before we signed and one friend of mine said their apartment was trashed when they moved in and they had to clean the entire thing themselves. They also said they had to do all the maintenance themselves because every drain was clogged when they moved in and they had to get pest control because their were roaches in their apartment.\n\nSo if you only take one thing away from this ASK AROUND BEFORE YOU SIGN!!!",

Lubbock is expanding quite a bit too so I\u2019d say soon there will be a lot more to do as well!",

Those white supremacists really be some reasonable ideas!\" unless they already thought that, but didn't want to say it out loud. \n\nNormal people don't decide to support a hate group because someone called them out on behaving like the hate group. Normal people say \"Oh shit, I don't want to be associated with that. I need to reconsider how I'm behaving.\"\n\nThanks for showing that you think the issue is someone connecting the dots to conclude \"supports white supremacy\" and not \"my behavior is, intentionally or not, supporting white supremacy\". \ud83d\udc4d",

However now after working as a CNA for 2 years I\u2019m no so sure nursing is where I want to be, after completing all the prerequisites and over 3000 hours of direct patient care hours.

And now with many years of exposure to for profit medical systems, patient neglect and abuse in assisted living, behavioral health and long term care nursing homes. I am pursing a Legal career in the hopes of getting my J.D. and working in Medical Malpractice Law, or as a U.S attorney, maybe pursue a federal clerkship by a Supreme Court Judge and even fun for Federal District Court Judge after 6-10 years of legal practice. Maybe go into big law for the financial benefit of pursing partner and eventually retire and open a Criminal Defense Attorney Law Firm.

After all the funds are applied I end up getting a refund of roughly $2,500. That means tuition and fees should run you about $6,000-$7,000 per semester (that is, if your bill looks anything like mine). \n\nIf you end up getting that $5,000 in scholarships (as well as in-state tuition), you should be looking at no more than $2,000 per semester in tuition and fees. If you live off campus, then that\u2019s pretty much all you owe to the university.\n\nI recommend living off campus because it\u2019s cheaper than living in a dorm (most of the time). On the low end, rent for a student apartment in Lubbock is about $400/month. On the high end it\u2019s about $1000/month. Most people I talk to are in the $500-700 range. \n\nHowever, I understand that off campus living might not be a possibility for everyone (especially international students). Hopefully someone can give you info on room and board, because I unfortunately can\u2019t provide any.\n\nA part-time job plus some preexisting checking/savings money should keep you afloat for rent, food, and gas. If you really need it, there are some student organizations that regularly offer free meals. Your parents/guardians could also get you a commuter dining plan if they have the resources to do so.\n\nBest of luck to you, and wreck \u2018em!",

If you want to get good opportunities after graduation (and they are definitely there) you need to be motivated. As much as people say its going to, ChatGPT is not going to be taking opportunities from anyone anytime soon. I got an internship during the school year that spanned from last semester to this month, and secured a position upon graduation in IT that makes a pretty comfortable income.

First time I went back home with the ttu sticker on the back of my car, I got tons of guns up from other cars, people letting me over (followed by a guns up). \n\nCommunications is a great school if you want to work in or around anything that has to do with sales, movies, tv, marketing (advertising). The other school in question; Rawls Business School is highly rated and isn\u2019t for the faint of heart. As mentioned before, my sister is about to graduate from Rawls.

You really won't stand out that much and there's a good chance that people will just assume you're 20 or 21. But even if you do look a little bit older than the other students, at your age you'll be seen as the older brother rather than a dad.\n\nFor reference, when I was 23, I started going to college clubs and organizations and I didn't really stand out all that much. I was in college groups and organizations from the ages of 23 to 27 until I graduated and as long as you're okay with hanging with 18-22 year old's, it's really not that big of a deal. Yes, I started looking a little bit noticeably older at 27 but like I said, a lot of people will not care that much.\n\nYou could go to college clubs and organizations for another 3-4 years and not stand out too much if you really wanted to. So you definitely have some time.",

Particularly, they work with Rawls to run a yearly research project with a 1000/semester scholarship for continuing students. The projects are somewhat interesting, but it depends on what subject you\u2019re interested in business. Really jumpstarts research! If she is interested in research/grad, I got into research by just looking up profs and going to their office hours(even if I wasn\u2019t taking their class). Wound up doing free work first, and then $25/hour remote. I would definitely encourage applying.\n\nCurrently about to enter my third semester of various research areas(economics, finance, math), so let me know if you have any questions!\n\nHere is the link for the Rawls program I know about, if it helps: https://www.depts.ttu.edu/rawlsbusiness/research/undergrad/",

On one hand, I really loved my professor for my Pi Squared class freshman year. He was awesome and had a lot of really interesting things to say.\n\nOn the other hand, there was...very little follow up after my freshman year. They had advertised that they'd help me get connected with undergraduate research. I received no resources or any help or counseling to get me connected with research after freshman year other than the occasional request to fill out a survey about my experiences in the program. They told me that I'd be placed on a research team by sophomore year and be able to work part time in research and be paid for it. That never happened because no one ever gave me more information than that.\n\nTo be fair, I was in the one cohort that was humanities based instead of science or engineering, so maybe people in the other cohorts had better luck or more resources but yeah I never ended up doing any real undergraduate research.\n\nThey might have improved the program by this point (I was literally in the inaugural class back in 2017 so I was the guinea pig) but idk. I didn't really get to do anything with the program after freshman year.",

But I could not tell you when it\u2019s allowed or when it isn\u2019t. \n\nBut in quite a few places, you\u2019re not supposed to ride them on the sidewalk. Because\u2026 you know. Side walk, not side bicycle. \nBut seeing as how we don\u2019t have many bike lanes (at least not that I have seen, granted that I don\u2019t own a bike so I\u2019m not looking for them) I figure the sidewalk is probably fine.

Unfortunately, the program leaves alot for us to learn on our own. \n\nI highly recommend skipping those though and going straight for the intro cloud certs. Company\u2019s are still moving a lot of their infrastructure to the cloud, and will care a lot more about those then the comptia ones. I would go with AWS or Azure to start since they have majority market share, and more companies will use one of those. \n\nAlong with that, make sure your development skills are solid as well. We get some python classes which is good. But if you can, learn Java and nodeJs, you\u2019ll have an awesome advantage when applying to internships/jobs.",

Overall, the roommate you are assigned (or choose) will affect how comfortable you are in any dorm, but you can always try to be a CA if you would feel more comfortable living in your own room (you would have to also be willing to do the duties of the CA). You can also try getting into nicer dorms like Talkington or West Village (only one side of West Village is for undergrad students though). \n\nTypically the university itself is accepting of trans students (and any other student that is LGBTQ+ or any other minority) but you may find that your peers are less accepting than you'd like, especially depending on what groups you find yourself in.

The bigger problem I would say is that the department doesn't have industry connections which keeps a lot of the students blind to what employers want vs what is being taught.

        "body": "You\u2019ll be fine. I went to undergrad at TTU in the CS. When I was there it seemed disjointed, changing languages between classes. This actually helped me in my career because when it came to picking up new languages, frameworks, technologies I had done it a couple times in school already. \n\nI didn\u2019t do any undergraduate research and it didn\u2019t effect me. Get a internship if you are able to. Being international I don\u2019t know the rules around that. If nothing else go to every single career fair you can. Look up every company hiring CS apply. Then apply to 10 more companies. Go to every info session. Seriously get FaceTime with recruiters that come to campus. I had a job lined up and did a single interview that was more conversation that interview. Before graduating and I had an average GPA. \n\nYou will have to put in some leg work. You\u2019ll have to be your own champion for your post undergrad opportunities. \n\nAs someone who is an alumni and seen how TTU students stack up against others in the work place. When it comes to hiring I will take a TTU prospect over others. I don\u2019t know how to describe it, the drive , the determination, the will. You may not be the smartest, the most refined, the highest scoring. When it comes time to get work done, TTU students do it. \n\nSo if you have specific questions message me. I love to answer. Also the alumni want you to succeed and when you look up where we land, it\u2019s pretty much a list of Fortune 100 companies. \n\nPro-tip: pick a minor that you can use to pad your GPA. The wind energy minor is algebra based so the math isn\u2019t too hard. Also you\u2019ll learn a lot about all kinds of energy so you\u2019ll be marketable to energy companies and they are always hurting for IT.\n\nPro-tip #2: Don\u2019t be afraid of the idea of \u201cworking in IT\u201d. Many older companies started IT depts  when it was mostly desktop support. Now the organizations in those companies have grown and have a lot more under them. I know predictive analytics teams working next to the critical infrastructure teams. That are next to the printer support teams. IT isn\u2019t just Office Space style work anymore. So when shopping for jobs don\u2019t be discouraged when you see IT. \n\nAlso enjoy Lubbock. It\u2019s different. It\u2019ll harden you in ways that you didn\u2019t know. You\u2019ll be able to learn to dance with competition dancers. Get drunk with oil millionaires. And hear the best jokes from the blue collar guys in the dive bars. Go to a football game and throw tortillas. See my post history to see other things I recommend. \n\nWreck\u2019Em",

I think you may also avoid cell bio by taking that concentration but may be wrong. \n\nYou\u2019d have a handful of required classes (bio 1, bio 2, genetics, organic evolution, etc) but then a large number of electives to tailor the degree to your interests. For example I took mostly ecology classes (ecology, community ecology) and taxonomy classes (ornithology, mammalogy, ichthyology, natural history of vertebrates, etc.)\n\nOne quirk with the College of Arts and Sciences is that you are required to declare a minor whereas other colleges within the university don\u2019t. Most bio students minor in chemistry since you would only need 1 more class to minor in it. Chem 1 & 2 and O Chem 1 & 2 are required for your major leaving 1 more class for a chem minor. Most people that I knew took bio chem but I chose to take descriptive inorganic chemistry.\n\nOverall I enjoyed it. I loved most of my professors and even stayed at Tech to get my M.S and TA\u2019d for one of them. Some classes are harder than others but in the end you\u2019ll get as much out of the degree as you\u2019re willing to put in. If I was given the opportunity to do college all over again I wouldn\u2019t change my decision to pursue that degree and concentration.",

It's pretty disappointing, as usual from Tech, and it's the reason why I transferred. Regardless, I'd argue that the Chemistry Department is a far better option than Biology at Tech if you're interested in that.

Knowing what I know now, and knowing Ph.D. students at schools across the country, I would absolutely make the choice to come to Tech again. If you have a car, look at apartments all over the city, not just near campus. You can get to campus in 15 minutes from South Lubbock -- traffic is not a thing here. Apartments tend to be in better shape, bigger, and have fewer people in one complex than those near campus. As you're considering Ph.D. programs, make sure to consider the cost of health insurance in your planning. The graduate student health insurance Tech offers is expensive and not very good. Send me a message if you have any more questions or if there is something I can help with.",

Guys ask eachother\u2019s chess.com rating like \u201chow much you bench, bro?\u201d\n\n\nOH, and the gym- like Crunch Fitness with the Rec. The Rec can close randomly for the most random and bullcrap reasons, so you\u2019ll need recourse in the 24/7 Crunch with a 9.99/month membership. PLUS you\u2019ll meet more people. But seemingly EVERYONE goes to the Rec, giving you access to everyone from the sorority girls to the Kurdish MMA master. Grad students need it most imo. \n\n\nBeyond those, I highly suggest you have some sort of hobby-pastime on hand to preoccupy yourself with, like video games, if you\u2019ve ever stuck here over Spring or Winter Break. You\u2019ll need them for intense indulgence until your buddies get back, otherwise it\u2019ll be a maddening wait. And if that falls short, pop down some over-the-counter sleeping pills like diphenhydramine so you\u2019ll sleep for 12 hours + grog for naps. \n\nTikTok is excellent filler whether you\u2019re high on life or not. \n\n\nDon\u2019t expect to get a get-by job easily here, especially if you\u2019re a guy. Lived here for over 20 years. Most of the restraunt industry needs front-end people, which usually goes to women. Guys are left to oversaturated what\u2019s left of back-end. Did Uber and Lyft too, and it quickly became saturated too: you\u2019d wait 1+ hour for an airport queue for a petty $9 or wait in town for $2-$3 rides, half of which will go to gas. \n\nBut the most important thing is all of that can be forgiven when you not only get involved in student orgs, but KEEP THEM ALIVE AND EXPANDING. I too aspire to the Ph. D route, and maybe you\u2019re aware of how hopeless and soul sucking academia can be. But if we\u2019re to fix that, we need to have something worth looking forward to by the day when the far tomorrow is not only NOT GUARENTEED, but DISMAL. Join a foreign language club or something, and play Cards Against Humanity in their socials. Connection: that\u2019s what helps us all combat the weight of mediocrity and daily is dystopia we need every ounce of sanity and patience to fight. \n\nDon\u2019t forget to create class chats and share accurate guesses and answers to.\n\nI know what I\u2019ve said depressing to read, but I guarantee you this is not exclusive to Lubbock or Texas Tech. I\u2019d just say it\u2019s the reality of Millennial and Zoomer life wherever you\u2019ll pursue your Ph.D. But ANYWHERE you go, your survival strategy is the same- *connect to endure and fight for something better.*",

        "body": "Lubbock is different. If you want to find live music you\u2019ll be fine. You\u2019re going to know about football even if you don\u2019t want to. Game day changes the entire energy of the city. If it\u2019s a major home game the city feels different. You will know the definition of a college town. Everything in Lubbock revolves around TTU because of the student population. Every Fall 20k move into Lubbock. The locals see it as part of the changing of the seasons. \n\nAs others have said you can find a lot to do with student orgs. I would recommend joining the camping and outdoors group. You can rent full camping gear for reasonable prices also they have trips out to the state parks far away.\n\nAs cliche as it sounds learn to dance. It\u2019s west Texas so you can pick up a lot of two stepping moves and salsa steps. This ends up being heavily influenced by west coast swing style dance so the skills translate pretty easy. Also great way to meet people. Some of the best dancers I danced with didn\u2019t drink they would go just to dance. \n\nAlso for the weather. You\u2019ll develop your own maurder kit, the random but necessary accessories to navigate the weather. Mine was a rain poncho, bandanna, goggles, a spare pair of socks. Campus drainage sucks and you\u2019ll learn this the first time it rains. \n\nSo many places to eat. Find J&B Coffee Co. that place is responsible for more PhD. than any department on campus. Has probably been mentioned in more graduation speeches than any professor also. \n\nAlso there is a drive in movie theater. Two movies for the price of one. You can bring your own snacks and they have car load nights so you can split however many people in a car. Bring camp chairs. So good value for the money. \n\nIf you are in town on the first Friday of the month the First Friday art trail is going on down town. All of the art galleries have showings and a few buses are going between all the galleries. This was a great way to start a Friday night because you could start at the galleries, drink the fancy wine/cheap beer then head to the bars downtown. They have different themes every month so it changes every month. \n\nLubbock is a great place to learn to not be bored if you have spare time.",

It was a shit show all season. He was even asked to take a buyout mid season, but he refused. \n\nIf anyone called him out on it they wouldn\u2019t be there anymore. See: Barrett Peery. \n\nHaving an awful relationship with our big money donors definitely doesn\u2019t help either. \nAt one point one of the big name donors said he wouldn\u2019t donate another dime until Adams was gone. \n\nThe whole Bible scripture situation was just a final nail in the coffin. The coaching search started way before Adams was suspended/fired. \n\nI expect the search to be done within 1-2 weeks and it will most likely be Grant McCasland. With our NIL, asst. pool money, facilities and fanbase he will thrive here. I can\u2019t wait.",

Despite being the second largest engineering major by enrollment, up till recently the only space on campus dedicated to the department was a hallway in the eoc building (not sure if that has changed).

There are so many organizations - and honestly a small portion of students make up Greek Life (I think it\u2019s 15% or so). At smaller universities, like SMU or TCU, I recommend people go through Greek Recruitment because it is a way to meet people (and honestly would recommend that you go through Recruitment Week at Tech even if you don\u2019t pledge - it\u2019s a great way to meet other freshmen and upperclassmen). At SMU/TCU, the proportion of Greek students is much higher and even though they have a lot of organizations, so many people are in fraternities and sororities that it is more of a default way to find your tribe.\n\nAt texas tech, it is absolutely not necessary. There are thousands of students and hundreds of clubs/activities - you will find your tribe even if it is not Greek affiliated.\n\nI encourage you to go through recruitment (what used to be called Rush) just as an opportunity to meet people. But there is no obligation for you to go through with Pledging. I promise you will find friends and things to do outside of Greek life as long as you make the effort to meet people and attend some activities. Good luck!",

A lot of the advisors listed on my colleges website (architecture) are outdated or downright wrong, so emailing for advice is useless and you'll never get answers. The wifi is really bad basically everywhere on campus. Dining plans are expensive and all the food is extremely unhealthy. Tuition itself is also outrageously expensive. And Lubbock is also as interesting as a bag of rocks.\n\nBut the thing is.. my sister went to A&M and had the same experience with the same problems, and I'm sure UT is similar. The big universities are always kinda bloated and shitty.\n\nOn an education level, I think it's pretty good. The professors at the Architecture college genuinely wanted to help you and the curriculum felt well paced. \n\nTL;DR \nIf I had to do it all over again, Tech may not be my first choice, but it's not a bad one. Its worst characteristics are some that all of the major Texas Universities share.\n\nPlus I'm coming back in the fall for my grad degree so it's not that bad lol",

We don\u2019t live in luxury but we do have the privileges to conduct our FTXs, ranges, aswell as pay for our Ranger challenge, color guard, Bataan death March teams on a regular basis. \n\nI assuming the scholarship you mentioned is the national 4 year scholarship. This can be competitive so don\u2019t plan your education around receiving it. ( out of nearly 60 incoming cadets in my class, only 2 had the national 4 year) that being said, ROTC offers plenty of scholarship opportunities. Depending on your work ethic and commitment, it\u2019s not impossible to receive a 3 year scholarship within the first year at college. \n\nWe conduct PT 3 times a week at 0600-0700. As a MS1 you\u2019ll have one military science class and one 2 hour lab a week. Other than that you\u2019re pretty much a regular student free to engage in other activities outside the program such as Greek life, clubs, sports, and more. \n\nI can\u2019t speak much for other schools but I feel as tech is pretty welcoming for new students and the ROTC program is the same way. Let me know if you need help with anything and btw you should follow our Instagram page @redraiderbattalionttu",

They don\u2019t get paid enough (sure tuition is free/mostly paid for but at least when your enlisted you\u2019re getting a livable wage). \n\nGetting up at 6am to workout and then go to classes while in uniform just seems insane to me in general. \n\n\nSo, to quickly conclude if you\u2019re thinking about ROTC I think it\u2019s just better to enlist then use your tuition assistance while AD. You can always transfer to be an officer later in your career if that\u2019s what you want. \n\n\nSide note: in the past I\u2019ve worked out with the ROTC program while I was AF AD. They (students) had some superiority problems. They didn\u2019t know who I was and tried to talk down to me because I guess I wasn\u2019t working out hard enough for them\ud83e\udd23",

Student Counseling has free sessions per semester, so I'd recommend getting with a therapist if that seems like a good option for you.

The engineering key is really close. The only 2 things that were a pain was that there is no elevators, and that you have to walk all the way around from the Z1 parking lot. Other than that no complaints. There\u2019s a computer lab near the lobby that my friends and I hung out in. We watched movies, drank, played catch, hit bongs, and most importantly studied all night in that damn computer lab. There\u2019s a dining place as well, it\u2019s called Sam\u2019s place that will be opening back up in the fall. The restrooms, dining hall, computer lab, laundry room are all being renovated right now, and will be opening up in the fall. But yea your best bet if your engineering is Bledsoe or Sneed. I personally recommend sneed. I had friends who lived in Bledsoe and they all wished they had choose Sneed. Whatever option you choose, make sure to have fun. Don\u2019t lock yourself in your room all day, that\u2019s the worse thing you could do to yourself. Mental health is a huge thing among students and that plays a big factor. Your freshman year will be your easiest so make friends to stick with throughout college.",

The pool is incredible and way more active than the Ave\u2019s, as well as the volleyball and basketball setup. The gym and study room setups are also a bit nicer as well\n\nHowever I personally think the apartment layouts of the Ave are better. Of course it depends on your setup and what type of an apartment you\u2019re looking for, but my friends had a 4 room at Wildwood all on one floor and it seemed really hard to have any privacy. The Ave has a much cozier setup IMO. And the amenities at the Ave are still nice of course (especially the movie room) but just not as nice as wildwood. \n\nLike others said, the long maintenance times and overall sleaziness of both management teams is about similar, as are all student living managers. I think the Ave is your best bang for your buck, and an impressive value, but if you\u2019ve got some money to spare and would appreciate the nicer amenities, Wildwood is a solid choice. PM me if you\u2019ve got any questions about either",

It's also possible to \"borrow\" hours from the previous semester if you've taken over 12 with permission.\n\n\nCall FinAid, but my assumption while you wait:\n\nAre you still at 12+ hours?\n\nThe problem your facing is since you dropped the class in the refund period. Some scholarships are total hours like the ttu Presidential Scholarship, so you can borrow hours and include Fall + Spring + Summer hours.\n\nThe Pell Grant is based on your status as a student FT or PT not total hours per semester individually. If you dropped a class in the refund period, the government drops their allocated funds for your Pell Grant as because Tech has to refund it to the government.\n\nIf you did drop a class in the refund period, a very bad way to get around it next time is just to drop it after that period has ended and take a hit on your drop limit. Don't recommend, but I've done it so it's possible.\n\nThe TPEG should still be there however. Unless the class drop adjusted your financial need.

        "body": "Most of the suite styles are probably taken by now....if you're in the Honors college then Honors is pretty decent although you don't have sinks in your rooms which kind of sucks. (source: lived there freshman year). I do believe the Honors dorm is really over-priced though, it's more expensive than Gordon and in Gordon you don't have community bathrooms whereas in Honors you do. It's ridiculous imo.\n\nFor the traditional styles, I'd say they're probably about even in terms of general livability except for Chitwood/Weymouth which you should avoid at all costs. Coleman can be hit or miss depending on if you get a good floor (source: I was a CA there) but it typically gets a worse rap than it deserves simply because it's close to Chitwey.\n\nBut I'd recommend avoiding the towers (Chitwood, Weymouth, and Coleman) anyways if you can. When I lived in Coleman we had SUCH an issue with the elevators. They'd get stuck all the time and when you live on the 12th floor, you kind of have to use them.\n\nIf you're a guy, Sneed does not have an elevator which is can be a deal breaker for some too. (source: I worked in BGS for a year too...the angry parents on move-in day when they realized they had to carry a mini-fridge up to the 3rd floor...). But that's the only dorm without an elevator...Sneed is just so old that it's a historically protected building now so they can't build onto it.\n\nOther than that, I'd say the other traditional style dorms are gonna be pretty on par with each other, pick one close to your classes.\n\nAnd I cannot stress enough...AVOID CHITWEY. My proximity to them when I worked in Coleman meant I got the nitty gritty details from a lot of the CAs there...I also saw all the 2 am fire alarms there from my window in Coleman, usually set off by some dumbass smoking or vaping in their room. It is well-known that Chitwey is where most of the freshmen planning to go to a frat/sorority live so you get a lot of partiers being loud and stirring up the worst trouble.",

        "body": "Hey! I have only gone a few times and only in the morning. They are open from 6-9am and then reopen at 11. I didn\u2019t know they were closed for a private practice from 9-11 so I got \u201ckicked out\u201d once. Plan to be done before 9am! Each time I have gone I haven\u2019t had trouble finding a spot. There is a team practice that starts at around 8am I think. As far as I know there is no lane restrictions other than not swimming in the same lanes as the team practice during practice times. You can enter in through the rec or through the aquatic center entrance. If you enter through the rec then you don\u2019t have to scan your id/ check in at the desk. That\u2019s only if you enter directly from the outdoors. The staff at the desk are usually friendly in my experience so if you have any questions you can just ask them. \n\nOh also something I didn\u2019t know at first. The automatic sliding doors to the pool (when entering from the rest of the main part of the rec) are on some type of airlock system? It\u2019s two sets of automatic sliding doors. The second one is not locked or broken you have to wait for the first door to close fully before the second will open (just something I wish I had know!)",

It's incredibly common for that to happen, but the procedure should have been for the hall office to initiate a lock change when the key was not returned. The office must have slipped on that one.\n\nI'd recommend contacting the hall office (not the overall Housing office, but the one specific for that dorm) and letting them know about this problem. It would be especially helpful if you have the room number. They can then look into it. If they don't look into it a few days after you call, call again but during normal business hours (8-5 on weekdays) and ask for a supervisor. The students that work the hall desks are often overworked and underpaid.\n\nAlso, I know someone else said that they believed if the student had already paid for the semester they couldn't kick them out but I know for a fact that's false. If a resident at any point in the semester is no longer a full-time student, they are removed from the dorms. I myself had to go through that process a couple of times for some of my residents. It's a stipulation in the Housing contract that the resident must be full-time enrolled at the university. They get a prorated refund though, so it's not like Housing just keeps their money.\n\nThe other possibility that it could be is that the person is rooming with a friend without being actually assigned to that room, which could explain why they don't have access to the building card swipes but they do have a key. This also violates housing policies if the stay is longer than 3 days. This does happen actually, especially if in a traditional style the other side of the room is empty but still assigned to a student that simply never moved in. Sometimes people \"move-in\" without actually being assigned to the room and just rely on their friend who was assigned to the room to let them in or share the key. The hall office should also take care of it if it turns out to be this issue.\n\nAnyways, hope that helps even though this is a few days old.",

If you are staying on the east side of campus (Talkington, Sneed, etc.) then you could park across the street (at one of the many parking lots) and walk across university to get back on campus. Not sure they allow 24 hr parking but I doubt any business owner would go to the trouble of towing, however don\u2019t consider that legal advice. Other than that you could park on the street in one of the many neighborhoods surrounding campus and walk. Either way you\u2019ll most likely have to park and walk to campus. This is why tech makes so much money off parking passes for driving students due to the lack of free parking near by",

They also have big alumni numbers that can be helpful when trying to get a job.

It\u2019s a numbers game where you just have to keep applying to as many as possible because you only need one. During my job search I applied on LinkedIn to at least 50 companies in the structural engineering field around the country and got 3 interviews and 1 offer. I also went to the TTU engineering job fair and spoke with at least 50 companies there and then in the very last row after being there for around 4-5 hours I found the company that I currently work for. \n\nDon\u2019t worry about whether or not you hit all the requirements they want on the application. Worst case scenario they say you\u2019re under qualified during the initial review of your resume and don\u2019t contact you. Just keep applying as much as you can. Check LinkedIn every few days for new openings and make sure to vary your search parameters. I applied for civil, structural, graduate engineer, and engineer in training positions as companies vary what they call you. \n\nFinally, don\u2019t be afraid to branch out of your field. I got a bachelors in civil engineering, a masters in structural, and work for a forensic engineering firm where I go to collapsed buildings to look at whether the steel can be reused but also tell people their property flooded cause they had a clogged drain from an installation issue. You only learn 5-10% what you need at your job in school so wherever you apply to you will have to learn new things. You might be chemical but you could look at water treatment, the medical field, the forensic field, environmental fields, or any other engineering related fields. All it does is expand the number of places you can apply to. \n\nAlso get your resume looked at. It\u2019s the first thing someone sees so it\u2019s good to get it cleaned up if you can.",

I'm a long time blue blood- grew up going to Duke and Carolina games, and then KU games. Getting to that level is a long term goal- if we keep playing like this, thats awesome. It will improve. The reality is we have a solid team and the expectations are just higher than is reasonable. Some sloppy stuff here and there but, in truth, tech has exploded on the basketball scene and is consistently solid. Our recruiting teams keep going up, accordingly. Since 2019, Tech has been in the conference with the 2022 nat Champs (KU), 2021 nat Champs (Baylor), and 2020 leading contender (KU). We have the toughest conference the last few years in my eyes. \n\nProud of our fellas and the coaches over here.",

After months of convincing and pestering your parents, they accept to take you on a vacation to the USA. You arrive there. For a few days, you have the time of your life, but, on the last day there, you pass by something called Lolicon.\r  \n\r  \nYou peek inside, as you saw a poster earlier advertising that one of your favourite cartoons will have a stand here. You expect to see other like-minded children of the same age as you. However, you are taken aback by the lack of kids there, seeing only deformed balls of fat that can only technically be considered human, which you approximate to be around 30-years old. Suddently, one of these shapes turns around its head, or at least you assume it is, for it has no neck. It yells at the top of its lungs, which are hidden under 40 layers of fat, \"OMG an actual, real life loli!\". The rest of the blobs all turn simultaneously towards you, lunging at you.\r  \n\r  \nYou start to run. The things aren't very fast, thank god, but you are slowly getting out of breath. While running away, you hear them screeching nonsense about how you should be their subservient waifu/slave, because they know how to treat wahmen. You see a patch of grass in the distance, and with your remaining energy, you sprint towards it at full speed, the heaps crushing everything in their paths. You land on the grass and pass out. Several hours later, the mounds are still there, but they cannot approach you. You see one of them try, but as soon as it touched the grass, it dissolved. You are safe, but cannot remain there forever, and you just hope your parents are still alive and will find you soon.",

We probably have more of a love for the place than others but it\u2019s really perfect to be young, raise a family, and just live a pretty simple life. We are not RAGE bar people but man we can appreciate a good ole beer or marg to take the edge off (all red raiders seem to have this edge lol so alas). \n\nSo to answer all your questions - this is coming from a life long Red Raider, alumni, etc. \n\nThings to know about Texas Tech: Literally, pick a nice spring day when the wind isn\u2019t blowing like crazy and get you a NICE ROUTE 44 DP and go on a walk of campus. If you hit up the presidents ambassadors, I feel certain they would volunteer someone to give you a personal tour of the university. Like any other school, we have some wonky traditions but some of the fun ones include throwing tortillas at football games, kissing a rock before exams, and lighting up campus every Christmas. You are SO lucky to be starting at Tech this year. Carol of lights began the centennial celebration of the school. Founded in 1923, the school is celebrating from Carol of lights in 2022 through 2023. Check out all the events here for the year: https://100.ttu.edu \n\nThings to know about Lubbock: I hope you like food. There are TONS of places to eat. Very diverse and tons of Facebook groups to join on these spots. I\u2019m super basic but I love Cafe J brunch and J&B Coffee. My dad went to Tech too and we have earl grey tea at J&B when we go back for games. He studied where I studied. It\u2019s a whole dang thing. Higher end food includes las brisas, double Nickel, and west table. Lubbock has plenty of churches. Unsure if you are a religious person but it\u2019s a great place to begin in finding community. \n\nYou don\u2019t have a \u201cbig age\u201d problem at all. There is a thriving young business/people/community sub-set in Lubbock. The truth is though that when you move to a new place, you have to be willing to put yourself out there to make some new friends. Go to some comedy nights, be willing to jump into some random groups and introduce yourself, etc. I know you say that bars ain\u2019t your thing but my lord the Piano bar is so fun. Snag some tickets to some tech basketball if you move early enough. Upper bowl is fine but if you work for tech I believe you will get access to faculty ticketing which is nice. \n\nHere\u2019s a quick list of some weekend activities: \n- Tech sports: even if you ain\u2019t a big sports person, just go and take in the atmosphere. \n- Palo Duro Canyon, Buffalo Springs Lake, and ruidoso are all outdoor spots decently close that you can do day trips to and hike/get outside. Ruidoso is further but my wife/I would wake up early, drive there, hike, and come back all in a day. If you don\u2019t mind camping, not a bad spot in the spring/summer. Check out forest service road 108 as it heads north towards road FSR 400. Nogal Peak hiking start. If you hike Nogal Peak in spring, it is so peaceful up there. The tech outdoor pursuits center is a good resource if you are NOT outdoorsy but want to try something new and become ourdoorsy. \n- if you golf, some great courses in Lubbock to get a round in. Believe you can get good deals at the Rawls course on lessons etc. if you want to give it a go as something new. \n- speaking of sports\u2026.GO TO THE REC CENTER. Sure it\u2019s full of students but families go too. The pools are badass and you can play pickle ball, basketball, racket, rock climb, and join all sorts of classes etc. just a great facility. Skip the shitty gyms and go here unless you have something specific you are into athletically. \n- if you don\u2019t have a dog, consider it! Lots of dog friendly spots in lubbock and a great way to meet folks. If you like cats, that\u2019s cool too \ud83e\udd2a\n- what are some things you are interested in? Can try and point you in right direction. \n- GO TO CHIMYS and chill with a marg. Thank me later. BierHaus is solid too.",

I think applying never hurts for these programs bc they\u2019re aiming at a wholistic, liberal arts school approach.\n\nThe reason most ppl were dropping was due to the structure of the program requiring two specialty classes(they didn\u2019t offer enough). They have a new dean and she seems to want to flip the retention rate, so applying now wouldn\u2019t hurt.\n\nPros:\nIf you want a degree requiring math you can take calc I-III, linear algebra with the best rated profs(the wife of the university\u2019s president teaches one). They offer pass/fail law and medical school classes in the actual schools for credit if you decide to go there. They offer an undergraduate thesis and have an honors only program that pays you for doing research if the prof doesn\u2019t. Earliest registration dates.\n\nCons:\nIf you\u2019re in business then it\u2019s not very easy to get hours.\n\nRequire a lotta hours, and the class registration is sometimes difficult bc all the hyperacademic kids are applying at one time. Weird classes \n\nThat\u2019s pretty much it, if you have any questions feel free to dm.",

Then you will get an email from the registrar with your department chair and the associate dean for undergraduate success (assuming that exists in the college you are talking about) saying which classes need to be addressed.\n\nI had this experience once several years ago when I didn't realize that there was one student left on another page of the grade entry system that I didn't see. In my case the associate dean sent me a spread sheet that showed me what class and what student was missing a grade.\n\nI will say this, the grade system at TTU is odd. Once I have entered the grades for a given course, they are not actually rolled into the system where you could see it for several hours. So, it is possible that the professor did it right at the deadline and you would not be able to see your grade updated in RaiderLink for a good bit. I know...it is weird.\n\nTo support what SGO\\_Nova said below (and add to it), I have never been upset when a student emailed me a grades question. However, copying the department chair is almost always not a helpful move.\n\nI will note that legally we are not supposed to discuss specifics of grades over email (you got an 89 because you missed questions X, Y, and Z) but we can discuss the timing of grades, etc. If you are worried about the grade not being entered, you should absolutely email the professor.",

My first fall semester I had matador, then I went down to the smallest bc I discovered I actually didn't need that much (I would often go to the cheapest places on campus and I'm petite). Anything left over is then rolled over to next year (if a new plan is purchased) or rolled over at a deficit (I think maybe 30% is lost ?? Not sure, with covid a lot of policies moved around!) if student moves off campus and no longer buys a plan. \n\nHope that helps!!",

Myers catches the flak because he was the AD at the time and did nothing to help the winningest football coach in TTU history.   \n\n\nAs I heard it, there were members of the board of regents who were pissed that Coach out maneuvered them   on his contract. In other words they were about to stroke a big check and felt like they had been hoodwinked by a coach who had his JD and worked with the james family to find some way to get rid of him to avoid paying him. Whether this is true or not doesn't matter. The higher ups in the university with the help of the james gang and the lack of intervention by hance and myers fucked over the man that put not just TTU football but the university itself on the map.",

I found management at 21 hundred to be  super easy to get a hold of, and the staff are responsive and knowledgeable. however, i had a pretty decent experience at both places. hope this helps :)",

Hence, fascist...like racist....has lost it's impact and when hurled at a person, often gets laughed off. \n\nI was called a racist once, just because my opinion on a subject differed from someone else, even though the opinion had zero to do with skin color. This is usally hurled at someone, when the accuser has no other logical side of their argument to use...so they just lower themselves and lazily call you....yep..a racist.\n\nI have found that many times, the types that would spread junk like this flyer are a tiny minority and they have next to no power.

I have also found that I have little reason to fear the ever-present boogeyman of white supremacists and have never run into these types and I live in a pretty white area.\n\nIt seem pretty common for white liberals to hate on their own race. This is a behavior I do not understand, as I sure don't hate on other Indians.

My weakness was having a Chic-fil-a right on campus. Whataburger is a Texas legend but Braum's has better burgers. Obviously there's a lot of amazing Mexican and Tex Mex food here but Lubbock also has a good selection of Thai food and a couple of other cuisines. If you're into cooking there are a couple of very good Asian and Mexican supermarkets. \n\nThe TTU rec center is really nice so take advantage. Also take summer classes if you can, most students aren't from Lubbock so they go back to Dallas/Austin/Houston for the summer and the whole town is a lot more chill.\n\nThere's quiet camping and good stargazing within 90 minutes. Or if you need mountains you can be in some real high terrain within 4-5 hours.\n\nWhat else?",

        "body": "My first piece of advice would be to get involved with the sporting culture here on campus\u2014even if you\u2019re not a sports fan. We\u2019re not necessarily a football school, but football is a way of life in West Texas. Go to a couple of games, and definitely smuggle in some tortillas. Our basketball team is our pride and joy, and the student section is electric (during conference play, at least). You don\u2019t want to miss these. Also try to learn some chants. If it\u2019s hard to find any info on those, we can teach you. They\u2019re not hard to learn.\n\nWeather wise, expect West Texas heat and dryness for most of the year as well as cold (but not brutal) winters. Wind is a year-round thing. It\u2019s annoying, but you just have to get used to it. There might be a tornado or two during the spring, but they\u2019re usually very weak, short-lived, and really only occur in the rural areas outside of the city.\n\nAlso try to adapt to the local style. By no means should you give up your own personal style, but it wouldn\u2019t hurt to have a few local pieces. Cowboy boots and jeans are always a good choice for a night out, and trucker hats are also pretty popular among men too (if you identify as a male) (and if you\u2019re into that look). I\u2019d say we also have a pretty rich t-shirt culture too. Very quirky. Stop by Red Raider Outfitter (there\u2019s multiple locations across town) and pick out whatever t-shirt speaks to you!\n\nBecome acquainted with the food scene. They\u2019ve already been mentioned in this thread, but Spanky\u2019s and Orlando\u2019s are local favorites. As far as chains go, Whataburger is king in Texas. Rosa\u2019s is a Tex-Mex chain exclusive to West Texas, and most people (myself included) love it. Try the sopapillas with honey! Aside from Rosa\u2019s there are many other Mexican/Tex-Mex places across town. I used to think they were common everywhere, but I forgot that most states don\u2019t border Mexico. Try to get tacos from small, shady-looking places. That\u2019s how you know they\u2019re legit. Real tacos can\u2019t be beat. Also get breakfast kolaches at least once. We Texans love our kolaches. I unfortunately can\u2019t tell you about the bar scene since I\u2019m a boring loser.\n\nFor activities, you can always join a student org, but there\u2019s also stuff to do outside of school. If you\u2019re into nature, most people like making the drive up north to see Palo Duro and Caprock. Other people can tell you about the non-nature things to do here in town. \n\nAlso learn how to drive in Texas. Nothing too scary\u2014just observe and pick up the driving habits of the locals. Speed limits are a suggestion, go the flow of traffic.",

Fat Dawgs (godrestitssoul) was THE place to go. The downside: Went through the worst dust storm in Lubbock in \"over 10 years\". Swore I'd never go back. Sure enough, wound up there as a Freshman in 1983. The weather was, and still is, schizophrenic...mud rain, thunder snow, dusty and absolutely gorgeous all in the same week but the Tech environment was then and is even more so now, great.  As a guy of 22 who is trapped in the body of a guy pushing 60, I still try to make a football game every year and wander to the student section. It's noisy, rowdy and fun! Bring tortillas! Haven't made a basketball game in years but the fans are the best in the NCAA. Hell their baseball and even track teams kick ass!  \n\n\nAs has been said more than once, Spanky's and Orlando's are a must. I met my wife at the Indiana Orlando's in 1985 when it was JT McCords. We went there for our 34th wedding anniversary in Feb 2020 just weeks before the shutdown. Drove up from Abilene. The food and service were top notch.  \n\n\nThere's always  been a solid local live music scene and there are some artists that I saw perform in the 80s that are still going strong now. A big name pops up for a show now and then too. Sadly there isn't a lot more of the bigger shows there...or even a festival.   \n\n\nI could go on a lot more. Enjoy your time at Tech. GUNS UP!",

Stuff doesn't drain easy off campus, so if it's wet, it's wet for a week\n\n2. Getting around\n\nThe bus system is pretty good for a small area, but if you're from somewhere with actual public transport, you're gonna be disappointed. Most of the buses are late and thats ok. But plan ahead, try to get to class 15 minutes early. Walking and biking are better, honestly. If you do get a bike, go to the police station and have them etch your student ID in there. Whenever you lock up your bike, lock both wheels and the frame. There's a tragic amount of chained, singular wheels on campus and off. \n\n3. Stuff on campus\n\nBoth the library and rec are amazing. Seriously, don't put it off, they're fucking insane man.\n\n4. Making friends\n\nUse the school website to search up clubs for your interest; I don't really make friends in classes, but I've made a lot of friends through clubs. There's political clubs, religious, hobbies, etc. \n\n5. Culture\n\nPeople are generally pretty damn friendly, you can ask just about anyone for directions and get them. People will smile and hold open doors, do the same. Sports and religion are both pretty big here? If you're religious, there's plenty of religious organizations through campus. Try to go to some games even if youre not big on sports; I'm not either, but it's still *fun*. It's mostly the drinking and energy, not the actual players\n\n6. What to watch out for\n\nMost of the restaurants near by are comfort food, and there's a lot of bars that take up a lot of people's weekend. Neither of those things are inherently bad!! But; if you let them take over all of your time and habits, you're fucked. Take care of yourself physically and mentally, and don't let FOMO convince you to get shitfaced all the time.",

It either gets lumped with Engineering, and they don't understand how to do it right because there aren't physical components, lumped with Math, and they don't understand how to do it because there is an aspect of engineering and design, or lumped with natural sciences, which is just laughable.\n\nThe only schools in the nation that do CS well are Stanford, MIT, and Georgia Tech. I especially like Stanford's model, which is very industry-focused. \n\nI'd change Tech's dept to be very project focused and industry driven:\n\n* Each semester you take on a project. These can vary from research-driven (the school's current focus) to startup-driven (where it should go).\n   * Freshmen join as Jr Engineers on upperclassmen projects\n   * Collaboration with school of business & school of art brings on product & market folks as well as designers\n   * Projects recruit students at a big presentation event to start the semester\n   * Projects can be taken up for additional semesters if they need further refinement\n* Startups that find market fit are launched and spun off with equity shares going to those that worked on the project as well as the school, who will provide bootstrapping resources\n* Curriculum is trimmed and made efficient, with a coding course each semester to support the project, deep dives on structures, databases, algorithms, and automata. Upper levels dominated by elective courses deep diving various advanced subjects like machine learning and data science.\n   * This is one of the biggest problems with the department right now: there is no \"flow\" to the curriculum. You repeat topics in various courses. Those who teach are so far disconnected with the industry that they teach ridiculous things that never come up. Had one prof claim that software engineering was making UML diagrams and then sending it to India to be developed.\n\nTry getting the dept to listen to reason and make any forward change?

So it\u2019s suppose to be Monday legs Tuesday upper Wednesday break Thursday legs Friday upper weekend off. For upper the first day is more chest focused so incline and flat press and I alternate which I do first per week. Also some type of chest fly Some type of shoulder press. Classic row and some type of pull down/over/downs. I also alternate between reverse flys or face pulls. Then just 4 sets for arms, that means 1 or  2 excercises 2 sets each whatever I\u2019m feeling. On shoulder focused day I only do 1 bench press but I add in an Arnold press or any other type of shoulder press in addition to my main one. And of course always lateral raises. For sets I usually do 4sets of 10 8 6 6 for the compound movements, adding weight each time reps go down and for accessory movements I do 3x8 or 10. Also for my secondary compound movements so like Arnold presses on shoulder focused day it\u2019s 2 sets of 8.\n\n\nLeg day I just do some type of squat, my favorite is the vsquat, someonething quad focused like the leg press leg extensions or hack squat then something for posterior chain like the leg curls or hip thrust machines. I also do abs on leg day I\u2019ll just do 1 or 2 excercises on the machines. I treat them as accessories. Sets are the same \n\n3. Idk I kinda just like it. It\u2019s nice tracking progressive overload and how much stronger u get. For me the challenge is just going. Because my time management is always bad and I have social anxiety plus just being lazy getting there a chore but once I\u2019m there I\u2019m working tf out.\n\n4. Chest focused upper by FAR\n\n\n5. Not currently need a consistent schedule first plus I go at weird times\n\n6. My diet is just enough protein for what I need in the day then staying in my calorie allotment\n\n\n7.

I can\u2019t think of any NFL player, much less a college DB that makes that catch without Sparkman being there holding the ball and handing it to him. Sparkman had the ball and had feet on the ground, so that should be a dead ball when his feet touched the ground. I think that\u2019s a touchdown, the refs said the \u201ccall stands\u201d which means they didn\u2019t see enough evidence to either confirm the call or overturn it. Frustrating because that felt like a turning point in the game.",

I HIGHLY suggest you speak to a lawyer. 3rd floor of the sub above the bookstore if I recall correctly. \n\nDon't worry about the consequences from Tech, you'll have to attend some sort of student conduct meeting and it will go on your disciplinary record but it's really not a big deal as long as you don't make a habit of getting arrested on campus with drugs. You're not getting kicked out or anything like that.\n\nDO worry about the consequences from the State of Texas. That's why you need a lawyer. If you really need to keep it off your criminal record then since you don't have prior offenses you can likely defer adjudication until after a probationary period (a year is typical) but be aware that probation is surprisingly strict and if you violate the terms even once then you recieve an automatic sentence and it stays on your record. If you successfully complete probation then the conviction will be wiped from your public record but you will have to pay for monthly drug tests, check in with your probation officer before leaving the county, attend drug & alcohol classes, etc., etc. and you aren't allowed to drink or be in a bar for any reason, even if you're over 21, which is bullshit frankly. And obviously if you commit any other crime for any reason then your probation is void. \n\nOh and if you hope your parents won't find out about this then you should know they are going to start receiving a bunch of mail from local lawyers in a few days lol, ask me how I know. Feel free to PM me if you have other questions.",

Granted you guys were arrested which stupidly bumps it up to level 2 where the minimum punishment was some sort of probation.\n\nWith that said these were the punishments many years ago and things have hopefully become even less of a big deal. I would bet if you asked around a little bit you will find people who also got caught smoking on campus. I graduated from Texas Tech a decade ago and I think the worst I ever heard was people who got caught smoking in the dorms were just forced to live off campus.\n\nBest of luck with everything!\n\nAlso FWIW I would use [www.avvo.com](https://www.avvo.com) to find a decent criminal attorney to potentially lessen your charge or at least your punishment. Also I'm not sure if Texas Tech PD still has their dumbass police blotter where they damage their students reputations by publicly releasing your name along with the crimes you were charged with on their log of police activity, but that shit will come up if people Google your name and depending on the outcome of your case your lawyer could get that removed as well.",

My prof was Yadav\n\nIt is difficult in the sense that you have to pay attention, actually do work outside class, and either possess knowledge of or really work towards understanding the django framework. \n\nThings to note:\n\n1. It is not the kind of course where exam questions will be stated verbatim in class. You have to review the provided materials and have a semblance of a grasp of  them to do well on exams\n\n\n2. The course project is (was) an e-commerce site built in python using the Django framework. I personally found this to be the most difficult part of the course, as the instruction was somewhat lacking and happened at hyperspeed.\n\n\n3. If you take Yadav, there is a minor language barrier. He tended to speak slightly faster than I could handle while interpreting and taking notes.\n\n\n\nHere's my solution to ALL of these issues:\n\nI spent more time in his office during office hours than I did any other prof. I got to know him, and he certainly knew me. We reviewed tests, asked questions, and viewed code. He never once seemed annoyed that I was there. He even managed to schedule time outside of office hours when my schedule didn't allow me to make normal hours. If you are struggling in this course and office hours is not something you are willing to do, you will probably have a difficult time passing. \n\n\nJust my $0.02, as preachy as it may seem. If I remember correctly, he curved a lot of the exams decently. \n\nHe's a smart guy, just has a poor reputation due to some slight deficiencies in teaching (nearly all of which are language and time based) and the \"show up and surf the web\" students. A little discipline goes a LONG way in his course\n\nEdit: Grammar and added thoughts",

They do take both into account, but I think the SAT is often either more important or easier to improve.\n\nThe extra credit hours will for sure help though. I got about 14ish hours from tests I took in high school during college level courses, and it put me about half a year ahead on my coursework.\n\nFor engineering especially this is really helpful. Even more so if you can get credit for calculus, chemistry or physics (since they count towards your major), or stuff like english or social studies, (since they are required by the state for college students).\n\nWith 30 extra credit hours already, if you do get in you will be very well off.\n\nAlso I believe they take your best SAT score as in your top math score and your top english score. So if you get an 800 in math and a 500 in english, but you retake and get a 700 in english, but only a 750 in math, they use the highest from across your tests. (would be 1500=800+700)",

Without a doubt the university wants to know if the instructors are legitimately shit teachers and will follow up, even if tenured. \n\nAlso remember, outside of the college of education, 99% of your professors have NOT taken courses in their doctoral programs on how to teach, especially in the hard sciences and math. That is why when a great teacher comes along in those areas, their courses are filled before registration even begins. This is not a rip on those areas at all, it\u2019s just how academia works, especially at a large research university like TTU.",

I don\u2019t like Abbott, and I didn\u2019t vote for him in 2018, but Beto threatening to take away church\u2019s tax exemption status for not following the Democratic Party platform is a BIG red flag. I would say the same thing if Abbott was threatening to remove the tax exemptions from Mosque\u2019s if they didn\u2019t follow the republican platform. The truth is, Beto is too radical of a pill for me to swallow. Again, I voted for him in 2018 because Ted Cruz sucks, but I can\u2019t do the same in 2022. They both suck, but only one candidate is seeking to destroy the barrier between church and state.",

Did you know the two doctors who were pushing these lobotomies were overshooting their improvements in the patients. They were basically lying. But the problem was the patients these procedures were first performed on, had no one to advocate for them. Only once the procedures started to be done on patients who had advocates did the system change. So in this situation the parents are the advocates.

At the very end the authors say \"Interpersonal microaggressions, made a unique, statistically significant contribution to lifetime suicide attempts and emotional neglect by family approached significance. School belonging, emotional neglect by family, and internalized self-stigma made a unique, statistically significant contribution to past 6-month suicidality. Results have significant practice and policy implications. Findings offer guidance for practitioners working with parents and caregivers of trans youth, as well as, for the creation of practices which foster interpersonal belonging for transgender youth.\" \n\nTrans children simply existing doesn't lead them to attempt suicide at higher than normal rates. It's actually people like you stigmatizing them and actively working against giving them the support they need that is leading them down this path. \n\nI'll say it again.

The rate at which this legitmately happens however, is likely not large enough to affect any statistics. \n\nThe journal you have listed me noted that many of the reasons trans people attempt and/or committ suicide were outside factors such as jobs, family acceptance, and lack of proper medical attention (it is mainly a mental thing). This also varies between countries, ethnicity, and class. \n\nFurthermore, the journal made no mention of 50% of trans kids you mentioned succeeding in suicide.

Of the companies you found, call each and ask for a quote on the trimming and edging of your yard based on the size and include anything extra like flowerbeds etc. if you require anything extra. Also ask what is their availability/timeline and if how you would prefer to pay is something that works.\n\n4. Compare multiple quotes received taking in to account when they are available depending upon how urgent you need the yard cut.\n\n5. choose the company that works for you the best economically/schedule\n\nAlso if you don\u2019t know how to adult or something in the future your parents or a friend\u2019s parents are likely more than willing to help if you have those options available to you.",

I didn\u2019t find much production from his office hours, he was very condescending and would say that these are things I should know. SI\u2019s are good, but you have to follow it up with problems. His exams can be overwhelming just because he\u2019ll throw a twist in a problem that you\u2019ve seen a million times, don\u2019t let that throw you off. Rinse and repeat. Lastly, his exams do get a little tougher especially going into the final but he does do the extra credit assignment to redeem yourself. I think on exam 3 he adds 20 points for extra credit. Stay on top of the homework (I believe a 85 gives you full credit) and try to stay on top of quizzes, those could make or break you in the end. Don\u2019t panic, you got this!

It or Talkington are the closest you\u2019ll get to apartment-style before you go to Carpenter/Wells or West Village, which are for upperclassmen only. Murray has four to a suite, but each person has their own room. You share a bathroom with one other person and then have a common \u201cliving room\u201d. You also get a fridge and (I think) a microwave. Murray has a Sam\u2019s Place (dining location) on the first floor which is convenient for food. The suite-style usually fill up fast, so if you want to stay there, get your housing stuff done the second it opens up for you. \n\nHonors is also pretty nice if you don\u2019t get into a suite style. It\u2019s next to Murray and is pod-style. You share a bathroom with your \u201cpod\u201d (usually around 16 people total) and then each room has two people in it (similar to a traditional dorm). Each pod also has a study nook and a private bathroom. Honors also has a Starbucks in the lobby if you\u2019re into that. You usually have to be in the Honors College to stay there though. A note about the Honors dorm: the first floor rooms have a much higher ceiling. Since the beds are lifted, this is really convenient if you can get one of the few first floor rooms. \n\nBoth of the above dorms are close to the Rawls College of Business Admin. which has a Chick-fil-A and Einstein Bros. in it. \n\nThe [Residence Hall Selection Guide](https://www.depts.ttu.edu/housing/halls/hallselectionguide.php) is also very helpful for room dimensions and general info. \n\nIf you have any other questions feel free to respond or DM me.",

I think the people being dicks forget that they aren\u2019t engineers, they\u2019re engineering students counting their eggs before they hatch. Something they haven\u2019t learned to stop doing, because they have yet to become engineers.\n \nFor what it\u2019s worth, it seems that every engineering firm I\u2019ve worked at paid their IT group handsomely. Not to mention, every IT department seemed to have the highest employee morale. If you want to work within engineering, but not necessarily *do* engineering, then IT would be great. Those guys continually came to my rescue and always had something to teach me. Nothing worth doing comes easy, though. IT will still have its difficulties in its own regard. You need to shake that high school mindset that things will work out and come to you. You\u2019ve got to earn everything from here on out and you absolutely can do it. Ironically enough, once you\u2019re done with school and enter the workforce, you\u2019re going to miss it! Take advantage of the time you have! Spend it well, spend it smart, but also find time for yourself. Once you put your nose to the ground and grind it\u2019ll be over before you know it and you will have a bright future ahead of you.

        "body": "Think of it like this. It\u2019s better to know it and not need it, versus needing it and not knowing it. But I will say, the reason you think chemistry has no relation to your major is simply because you don\u2019t fully understand your major, and you haven\u2019t taken enough chemistry to understand some of the important principles. I\u2019m not trying to come off as rude with that statement, I\u2019m just trying to help you realize you\u2019re assuming there is no relation, which is incorrect, and that is from a lack of experience which is no fault of your own. I mean, you\u2019re just getting started, who could expect you to know what you will and won\u2019t use? I guarantee that by the end of your semester, there will be things you learned in chemistry that you would understand why they\u2019re necessary to know. Again. Engineers do not count their eggs before they hatch. The only assumption you should make is that you WILL use the things you learned.\n\nI think you stand to benefit substantially from having conversations with the CE advisors as well as some computer science advisors. Engineering is a hard major, a very hard major and a lot is expected of you, but a very rewarding career. \n\nWhat is it that interests you? What do you want to do? Don\u2019t believe that CE is your only choice to enter an industry you enjoy, there are always other avenues and I\u2019m happy to help you explore them.",

Computer scientists design and improve computational system softwares and algorithms. It is heavily reliant on data science and programming.

In the student handbook there\u2019s information on \u201chow to file an incident report\u201d about people that harass students. I doubt it does much considering these speakers come back every year. So instead, I\u2019m in the process of getting an op Ed published about free speech on college campuses and why hate speech shouldn\u2019t be allowed. Colleges boast inclusivity yet the second you walk outside to the library you face sexism, racism, and verbal harassment. Hopefully that helps. Could also consider forming a petition to stop hate speech in \u201cfree speech areas\u201d",

        "body": "All good questions! First, there are actually no laws currently in place for hate speech. There are laws for hate crimes and speech that portrays a specific intent for crime (threats).\n\nSecond, hate speech is a little vague, but I like this definition the best. Hate speech is \"any form of expression through which speakers intend to vilify, humiliate, or incite hatred against a group or a class of persons on the basis of race, religion, skin color sexual identity, gender identity, ethnicity, disability, or national origin\"([Keneth Ward, p. 765](https://repository.law.miami.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1693&context=umlr)). In other words, hate speech is targeted with vicious language, usually pointed at race, ethnicity, gender, or sexuality.\n\nThird, I'm hesitant to say that there should be laws in place that prohibit hate speech. It might cause more problems than it fixes. Especially because the lines between hate speech and just hurtful speech might be hard to prove. Also, it could become a little dystopian in nature if you start prohibiting certain speech.\n\nNow, what I do propose is in terms of college universities specifically. I think colleges should pass their own rules that either: a) limit free speech areas to students, student organizations, and faculty or b) have strict conduct rules enforced that would ban hate-speech speakers from campus. This is due to the fact that students are paying thousands of dollars to attend the university. They are paying money to a place that claims inclusivity and a welcoming environment. A student can't just choose to not walk to class. These speakers are more than welcome to find another public space, one where everyone has equal ability to leave. Further, the students that pay these large sums do not have the same \"free speech\" as the \"activists\". Students are held accountable and if they were to behave in the same manner, they would easily be reported and under investigation. Finally, a lot of students live on campus. There's dorm housing right next to the SUB. It certainly doesn't feel safe to have someone yell discriminatory language towards you as you are simply trying to get home.\n\nHope that makes sense.",

It has also been 9 years since I graduated but im in Lubbock at least once a quarter to see family or go to football games. Im a season ticket holder! \n\nPROS: \n\nLubbock is dependent on Texas Tech and this provides an atmosphere of immersion and total support in the city that you don't really see at some of the bigger schools. During football season, and lately basketball season, everyone has a tech flag flying and is wearing red and black. \n\nLubbock is big enough to have plenty to do, but not big enough to where you can get into too much trouble. As a freshman, exploring being on your own and having fun, I really liked this aspect and think its a slept on benefit of the city. \n\nTexas Tech is overall a great school with good professors and has a beautiful campus. \n\nThe campus has been renovating, building, and remodeling like crazy the past 10 years. You'll still have classes in almost 100 year old buildings, but for the most part you'll be in nice, new, state of the art buildings. \n\nTech and Lubbock are both very affordable, when compared to the other bigger colleges. Coming from someone paying back student loans, this was a huge benefit. \n\nLubbock has been growing fast the last 10-15 years and has almost all the same shops and restaurants you could get out in Dallas, Houston etc. There's a lot of chain restaurants, but plenty of local places as well. Almost anything you would want to go to in the bigger cities, has a location, or a pretty good knockoff (4ORE vs Topgolf) in Lubbock. \n\nCONS:\n\nLubbock is a good 5 hours by car from any \"decent\" major Texas city. If you like to roadtrip, this is a challenge. However the airport has direct flights to all of them, and sometimes they are only a couple hours apart, so you have plenty of flights to chose from. Bonus, security lines were never longer then 5 minutes anytime I've been. \n\nLubbock itself is flat and windy. It isn't everyones cup of tea in terms of natural beauty, but a West Texas sunset certainly can't be beat. If you're looking for beaches, mountains, or anything of the sort, Lubbock doesn't have it. But it does have canyons, small lakes, and plenty to do outside otherwise. \n\nTexas Tech isn't considered a top tier school. UT/A&M will look more prestigious on a resume, but by no means will this keep you from getting a good job. For way less in cost of getting your degree, I think this is kinda a moot point. \n\n\nThese are the major ones I can think of without knowing your specific situation (where you're from, what you like to do, etc..) but hopefully that gives you some guidance! Let me know if you have any other questions and I can hopefully help. Wreck 'Em!",

I'd say one of my favorite things about it is that it is a smaller city and it's a lot easier to not get distracted. It's a great place to buckle down and focus on the degree at hand while having some fun along the way. \n\nThe ECE program in itself is fantastic and can provide a ton of opportunities for you after you graduate. It's a lot more hands-on than other ECE graduates have told me about their schools. I'd encourage you to take a weekend trip down and see what its all about.",

        "body": "Another alumni. I definitely would go to Tech all over again. I graduated from Rawls with a BBA in IT. The Rawls IT program was very good, what I learned there has given me an edge in my career in data. It was less in-the-weeds technical than the CE counterpart, but that's what I wanted so I really enjoyed the coursework. Not every class was amazing, but I would only classify one course as actually bad. That was solved by dropping the course and taking it with a different professor, and it ended up being one of the best courses then.\n\nLubbock is pretty secluded from the rest of big city Texas, sure, but I loved that. I drove to and from Galveston for holidays, which was about 9hrs in the car. Living in Lubbock at that point in my life was absolutely worth the trips back and forth. I pretty much just did school , no night life for me at that time, but there's a bit of that there too. I really miss how walkable the campus and the surrounding areas are. Given beautiful weather, it's worth taking a day to just walk around campus and the surrounding neighborhoods.\n\nEveryone has different experiences there, but I would definitely do the life and schooling up there given the chance. Highly recommend.",

Try \u201cThe Organic Chemistry tutor\u201d- he covers so many early chemistry concepts as well. There are so many free resources available online, sometimes it just takes a second to sift through them and find what works!\n\nTake this from a chemistry major, who tutors chemistry: you do not need to PAY for tutoring!

I went in and they had me have a consultation with a therapist for like 15 minutes, by the end of which I was sobbing because I wanted to die, and she prescribed me 7 meetings and she said I\u2019d start seeing a therapist in three weeks. I guess I was anticipating seeing someone right away due to the severity of my issue and I didn\u2019t really love the \u201c7 meetings and you\u2019ll be cured\u201d idea but I understand they have to do this because it\u2019s a free service and every student needs access to it. I ended up going maybe 4 times, not loving my therapist, and I ended up just going to a therapist off campus that took my families insurance so I pay like $30/session. This was just my personal experience and I think the badness of it was exacerbated by the fact that I was VERY unwell. \n\nPros: on campus and easily accessible (it\u2019s in the student health building near the rec), it\u2019s free, they are catering to students so they are familiar with college students issues \n\nCons: I didn\u2019t like the system in general because I was used to regular therapy. I didn\u2019t like being prescribed a certain amount of meetings and I wasn\u2019t in love with my therapist but I suppose they probably would have let me change but at that point I was over the entire experience. \n\nI hope you get the help you need and find a modality that works the best for you!",

My first experience back in 2019 wasn\u2019t great. I didn\u2019t really feel comfortable with my counselor, and the main help I got during that experience was getting a recommendation to get prescribed on anti-depressants through the student health center. The other times I went in 2021 and 2022 were much better. I got paired up with counselors that were great and super affirming, and I learned a ton!\n\nA majority of the counselors there are students. For my initial triages I worked with actual counselors, but two of the three times I worked with students in my individual therapy services. They will disclose this with you during your initial appointments.\n\nAnother service the counseling center offers is offering guidance towards other counseling services if they are unable to accommodate your needs. There\u2019s a case manager you can meet with who will look up therapists in the area that takes your insurance, or they\u2019ll recommend you to the Family therapy center or Psychology center depending on your needs. They can also offer this service if you\u2019re moving and needing to find therapists in another area.\n\nI also know they offer group therapy, but I\u2019m not sure what that\u2019s like since I haven\u2019t used that service. \n\nIf you decide to use the therapy services on campus, go ASAP! They do fill up individual therapy very fast, especially during midterms and finals season where everyone is feeling stressed. Also, the triage time kinda sucks, and they will not let you leave until you talk to someone. I had to skip one class since they only offer triages from 12:30-3:30 and if you don\u2019t get in at 12:30, you\u2019ll be waiting for awhile.\n\nSo long story short, the experience can be hit or miss. They definitely try to help meet the needs of students, but the services can be stretched fairly thin. It\u2019s definitely a place to start, but it\u2019s also not the end all be all.",

I think this time varies though based on how busy they were, so you may have a different experience. \n\nWhen it comes to other therapy, there\u2019s so many great options! A lot of it is influenced by your insurance/your parents insurance but there\u2019s also sliding scale out of pocket options (my boyfriend doesn\u2019t have insurance and he pays $60 per session). \n\nIf you do have insurance I\u2019d recommend going to Psychology Today and putting in that insurance and then put in Lubbock as your location (or Texas if you\u2019re willing to do virtual) and then reach out to the therapists that catch your eye. I personally am doing virtual therapy because it works best with my schedule but I know a lot of people prefer face to face. Once you get in contact with a few therapist they will usually reach out to you and do a short 15 minute consult call where they tell you what they specialize in and you tell them what you need and you decide if you\u2019re a good match.\n\nFor affordable therapy without insurance there\u2019s a few small websites like Open Path Collective, just avoid Better Help",

        "body": "Very short (usually two-week) 'semesters' between the regular ('long') semesters.\n\nHere's Davis College talking about what their students did during a recent 'Maymester':\n\n[https://www.depts.ttu.edu/agriculturalsciences/slideshows/maymester.php](https://www.depts.ttu.edu/agriculturalsciences/slideshows/maymester.php)\n\nBasically, when everyone takes a break and goes home or does their own thing after their last final in the Fall or Spring... students taking a mini-mester pour themselves back into a class that is ***much*** more compressed than a summer session.\n\nI never did a mini-mester, but one of my roommates (who graduated with a 3.8 or 3.9 in three years) did.\n\nHere's also a couple Study Abroad pages mentioning a Maymester:\n\n[https://www.depts.ttu.edu/international/studyabroad/students/apply/programs/program.php?id=11174](https://www.depts.ttu.edu/international/studyabroad/students/apply/programs/program.php?id=11174)\n\n[https://www.depts.ttu.edu/international/studyabroad/students/apply/programs/program.php?id=11769](https://www.depts.ttu.edu/international/studyabroad/students/apply/programs/program.php?id=11769)\n\nEspecially depending on your major, you will probably want to be very careful/strategic in deciding what class to take during a mini-mester.\n\nLike, just because your college/dept offers one, does not ***necessarily*** mean you should 'jump' and take it.\n\nAgain, it's 'a class that is ***much*** more compressed than a summer session'.\n\nSo, just for example, if [Statistical Methods in Agricultural Research](https://oneclass.com/blog/texas-tech-university/152368-10-hardest-courses-at-texas-tech-university.en.html) (which is actually an Econ class, AAEC 4302) would be a hard course in a long semester, and maddeningly-difficult in a shorter summer session... it's probably not a course you'd want to try to take in a mini-mester.\n\nLuckily/thankfully, most depts know this, and that (hopefully) wouldn't even be a course they offered during a ridiculously-short mini-mester.\n\nThey tend to offer more 'fieldwork' courses during these, but again it varies (a lot) by dept/major.",

I\u2019m sure just like every university ever people do commute but since there\u2019s upperclassman and underclassman dorms I think the majority of students live on campus, at home with family, or rent from nearby houses and apartments. Honestly when it comes to the campus itself I love it. I toured both A&M and UT and hated how spread out both of them were and honestly I found tech to be the most attractive campus and the one I felt safest at (huge homeless population at UT unfortunately). That being said it\u2019s a big university so you\u2019ll see different people until maybe your 3/4th year where the classes get more specific. In my senior year psychology classes of like 20 people I\u2019d say I know a good 1/3 of them and I\u2019m not very social. Overall, a public school in Texas is a public school in Texas but I really enjoy it here and I\u2019m happy I didn\u2019t pick UT ( more expensive, more commuting, homeless ppl on campus) or A&M (just flat out got bad vibes and it\u2019s ugly af there).

        "body": "\\- Tech, UT, and A&M are the 3 \"big\" schools in Texas, not just in terms of # of students or campus size (though Tech has the largest campus), but also popularity and (inter)national reputation. If you want a true American and/or Texas university experience, these are the best schools to look at, but as you didn't mention applying to UT and A&M I'm going to guess you already figured out that UT and A&M are both expensive and the most competitive for admission. To me, Tech has always been the best of everything: a quality college education, with tons of activities and opportunities, but at a great price and without the pretentiousness of the other schools! And, all on a gorgeous campus (seriously, look at Tech's campus, then go look at the campuses of the other schools on your list, and then look at Tech again. No comparison.) Also, fuck A&M. \n\n\\- Tech absolutely fits all of your criteria. The campus is huge (literally a square mile) but still self-contained compared to urban schools, and (Texas heat not withstanding) very walkable. Although most students do eventually move off-campus, it is absolutely NOT a \"commuter school\". (A commuter school, for those who don't know, is similar to community college where there is little to no on-campus housing, so students have to commute from home.) At Tech, on-campus living is mandatory for freshmen, and then there are dorms tailored for upperclassmen. The reason most students leave the dorms is only because there is a huge selection of student apartments nearby that offer all the pluses of campus living but with more independence/better quality of life.\n\n\\- As others have mentioned, class size varies widely depending on the class itself, but that's something you'll encounter at ANY public US university. The classes most likely to be held in large lecture halls are the intro-level classes that everybody has to take. As you start taking classes more specific to your major/minor, classes will get smaller and smaller. I had classes in everything from lecture halls, to normal 20-30 people classrooms and labs, to seminars with a dozen people. And I absolutely had professors that I got to know well and could turn to for anything. I had one class where we did our final presentations at our professor's house.\n\n\\- Another misconception people have about large state universities is that you'll just be lost in a sea of people and have no sense of belonging, and that it's hard to make friends. IDK about other schools, but not here. The first thing everyone notices setting foot on Tech campus is the strong sense of school spirit and community that even some small schools don't have. There are so many diverse organizations, clubs, sororities/fraternities, sports teams, jobs, etc. for every conceivable interest, that even I, a nerdy introvert, had no problem finding my niches and making lifelong friends. In my experience as a dorm CA (resident assistant), it was only the kids who didn't leave their room and didn't try anything new that complained about hating school and not having friends, which will be true no matter where you go.\n\n\\- Despite Lubbock being in conservative West Texas, it's still your typical American college town, where most nightlife revolves around bars/clubs/parties. But again, there's something for everyone. The biggest downside is that it is literally hours away from any of the large metropolitan areas (Dallas, Austin, San Antonio, Houston). That said, most Texas college kids have cars, so taking a road trip out of town on school breaks is pretty common.\n\nWow, that may be the longest reddit comment I've ever made! I hope that answers your questions. I also attended UH for a few semesters before transferring to Tech, so DM me if you like and I can answer more specific questions about UH or TTU.",

Really you have a choice when you pick your classes if you end up in a large class or not. \n\nTech is a semi commuter school I would say. Most students aren't from Lubbock I believe. Lots of on campus housing but also a lot of off campus housing close to campus so you can walk, bike or take the bus to campus. Most freshman have to live on campus, after that, up to you.\n\nTTU is it's own campus. It has roads in it of course but nothing major like UT Austin.\n\nUp to you if Lubbock is boring or not. Coming from Houston, Lubbock was nice, just long drive from home. My weekends were spent at the gym, church, studying and watching sports with my friends.\n\nResearch the CS department at these different schools, I've been hearing that TTU's department is iffy now a days.

Regardless of where you go, it\u2019ll likely be that way. Most of your major classes will be much smaller. \n\nTech requires freshman (unless their parents live within 45 (I think) miles) to live on campus. Some people stay longer than that. Plenty of people commute. That being said, there are tons of apartments right by campus. So you could live off campus with some friends, but still be right there next to it. Most of your upperclassmen are commuting. Most people don\u2019t want to abide by campus rules longer than they are required (no alcohol, being quiet at night, sharing a room with someone, having to move out during the summer, etc etc etc etc). \n\nTech does have roads, it\u2019s a very large campus. However, students and the general public are not allowed to drive through campus during the day. There\u2019s some roads on the outside of campus so people can get to their dorms, parking lots, and whatever else. But the inside of campus generally only has employees and busses from something like 7am to 5pm. I don\u2019t remember the exact times, it\u2019s largely irrelevant to me personally. \n\nAs far as enjoying Lubbock as a place goes, it REALLY depends on where you come from. If you come from a small town like myself, Lubbock has so much to do. Lots of restaurants, lots of bars, stores, main event, 4our (basically top golf), etc. I personally have more than enough entertainment here. However, you\u2019ll see people that come from larger cities (Dallas, Houston, Austin, etc) who are bored here and feel like there\u2019s nothing to do. It really depends. \n\nI grew up close ish to UNT which I see you have also mentioned. I personally would say it\u2019s harder to drive to their campus and drive around their campus. I will also say, it is a beautiful campus. (Tech is also beautiful, they just look very different). From my understanding, UNT has a ton of commuters (look\u2026 most schools are going to have tons of commuters). Denton is a really fun city. And although much smaller than Lubbock, it has something Lubbock doesn\u2019t. Which is proximity to other places. Lubbock is very much it\u2019s own place. Amarillo is about a 2 hour drive from here. Everything else is at least a 5 hour drive. Denton is next to plenty of other smaller cities as well as Dallas and Fort Worth. \n\nI will say. Denton and all of the places around it suck to drive through most of the day. Lubbock doesn\u2019t really have traffic. The rush hour times of the day are by far the worst of traffic (minus graduation weekend and major football games when there\u2019s a ton of people in town) and truly rush hour just isn\u2019t that big of a deal here. But Denton traffic? SUCKS. If you don\u2019t drive, then it doesn\u2019t matter I suppose.",

I guess I will apply to both UNT and Tech and hope for the best!",

Class sizes are the same, she likes the campus because there are water features like ponds etc that we don\u2019t get in west Texas. The weather tends to be more humid and warm in comparison to Lubbock which gets all four seasons. She and many students commute between txst and austin so I think it is more of a commuter school, although I know many people still probably live on campus since it\u2019s so close to austin I think commuters are more prevalent.

Remember that it will always start out big (because everyone wants to do what we do), but you will see that you start to see the same guys over and over as your studies progress. More than that, you'll see who the 'serious' people are, because they'll be the ones setting up group studying sessions etc. So many of the friends I made as an EE came from the 'trench brotherhood' bond that developed as we were all stressing and working together to get through that next quiz/test/project.I respect every single one of the guys (and girl) I graduated with, because I know how hard it was for us all to get to that spot. And it had NOTHING to do with how smart anyone was. Smarter people than us dropped STEM. We just knew how to work hard, and it paid off.\n\nI sincerely hope you pick Tech, man, but honestly; from what I can see already, you're going to be successful no matter where you go. So best of luck!\n\nps. Last piece of friendly advice. Attend EVERY job fair. Most colleges have engineering job fairs each semester, and it's vital that you attend every one (even as a freshman). You won't land a co-op/internship as a freshman (since you have no experience or class experience yet), but it's important to get that exposure to the recruiters and companies, because I guarantee they'll be there for the next one, and the next one, etc., and by your sophomore/junior year; you'll be ready to line up that opportunity, and they'll already know you are.",

You get 20% off at Quiznos in Burkhart, the RCOBA Chick-fil-A and Einstein Bagels, Raider Exchange at West Village, and the Starbucks in the Honors hall. \n\nI had the same dining plan last semester and I ate almost all of my meals on campus and still had some money left at the end of the year (by the way, and left over dining bucks in your account will be converted into a commuter plan for the next year, but they take 20% of them when they do that\u2026). Towards the end of the year, you can also buy bulk items if you have a lot left over and you want to use them.\n\nYou can find more info in the [TTU Dining Guide](https://www.depts.ttu.edu/hospitality/pdf/DiningGuide2021-22.pdf) (that one is from last year but it should mostly be the same.)",

I studied abroad and since you go with a group of people there is no choice but for all to meet each other and become friends. Especially if you go to a country where no one speaks English.",
