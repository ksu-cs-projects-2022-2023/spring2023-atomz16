But not just that, it's also the end (hopefully) of 3 years of harassments and abuses waged by Duncan against his neighbors and their pets. I have informed him and his spouse on more that one occasion that it is a felony to deprive people of their pets. Despite doing so, this is the third cat I have lost. A close neighbor has lost one.

They\u2019re huge for funding and having even the chance for in-person classes will bring a lot of students back. It\u2019s fucked but schools all over are hurting for money and some may very well close.

Again, I want to reiterate, I don\u2019t think that justifies this. I am very much so not comfortable with in-person classes, as much as I hate online ones. I think it\u2019s gonna end up getting people sick but this is a decision that K-State very likely will not back out of until at least the school year has started. \n\nThis is true. I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s justified, it does suck.

I think there was a data dump of racist groups' chat messages where somebody claimed they had put up posters at several Kansas universities, but it's been long enough since that news broke that I'm not finding it by googling. I think it was also unclear if or where they were attending college.\n\nI will say that you'd be unlikely to even know that bulletin board existed unless you were familiar with Seaton and had reason to be there, but it's also possible it was just a target of opportunity. The Denison poster was at the street crossing between Goodnow and the rest of campus. Again, likely a target of opportunity.\n\nK-State ended up putting up cameras covering that entrance into Seaton a few months later because of a different incident where some students caused some damage (unrelated to racism) and also ended up locking most of the buildings doors at night except for where they had cameras.

The primary values of conservatism are fiscal responsibility and small government and free market economics. In fact, the GOP was founded on the Abolition of Slavery in direct Opposition to classic Southern Democrats.\n\nMeanwhile, the core of national socialism is that individuality is counter-productive to the state, racial purity is the only way to achieve a peaceful society, the idea that we need to return to our formal glory, but that the past had it wrong. We need to take a new way forward. Their way forward. That is the only way we are going to survive the threat posed by <insert target group here>. Private enterprise is allowed, but it is expected to be at the mercy of the government, and the state will be strongest when these things are absolutely enforced on everyone.\n\nThe ideas of national socialism and conservatism are directly opposed. That being said, how these two movements have started to merge at the fringes is really worth examining.\n\nThe connections are being drawn due to white nationalist leaders' desire to reframe their movement in order to develop a stronger power base in the country. If you look at some of their primary spokespeople, they tend to be exceptionally attractive, well-spoken, clean-cut and just all-around likable people, until you start breaking down their message.\n\nAdd to this the open associations with white-supremecist groups, and the coded white supremacist ideals (such as AmericaFirst's founding idea that they want to \"fight against the globalist agenda). It falls in line with the idea that there is a group of Zionist Jews who are working towards world domination. \n\nJust as a very pertinent statement here: It is important to recognize that these white supremacist groups are all about using symbology and codes. It is a part of their culture. Bad stuff tends to happen to them when they are exposed. They are fired. They are shunned from society. So many seek to hide it.

Some professors may personally cancel class, or post an online lecture. Just need to ask.\n\nEdit: After posting, I realized my top sentences sounded kind of shitty. But what I mean by that it's K-State won't cancel for something like that. I'm in engineering so some professors literally have to teach material and squeeze it into a semester or risk losing ABET accreditation, which is vital for the college of engineering and students graduating to get jobs in industry. That's why they leave it up to professors. Some professors could give two shits about sports and won't budge and may even require students to be there. It just depends.",

The talent isn't there and I fault the coaching staffs inability of recruiting quality players. It was bad when Snyder for the first time threw his players under the bus when he said something along the lines to: \"I can't coach anyone who can't grow, x amount and can be faster.\"\n\nThompson just lacks the intuitiveness that most competent QB's have.

As the formation moved, it looked for all the world like the Jayhawk was eating a dick.\n\nIt was conclusively proven to be accidental when a band member posted their formation grid papers clearly showing that the Jayhawk was never meant to be shown eating a dick. It was just an unfortunate accidental consequence of how the people had to move on the field. Plus watching a video of the performance, you don't even see the dick. It moves by so fast and you only see it if you pause the video and watch it frame-by-frame.\n\nBut the damage was done and people on /r/kansas and /r/cfb still remember it as being deliberate. I've gotten hundreds of downvotes for trying to explain this to the world, but it's hopeless. People can't even get it through their skulls that they were doing a Star Trek themed performance, so \"it was supposed to be the USS Enterprise\" sounds like a cop out to them.",

That\u2019s a pretty long list if you\u2019re just asking about between me and my opponent, but here are a few of my bigger ideas:\n\n* Adding a high-income earner tax bracket\n   * The top 1% of Kansans make over $350k/year, yet are in the same bracket as Kansans who make $60k/year\n* Passing common-sense gun legislation, including: \n   * Red-flag laws;\n   * Universal background checks; and\n   * Banning guns on college campuses.\n* Ensuring equality for all Kansans, including such measures as:\n   * Expanding existing anti-discrimination laws to allow any Kansas resident who is fired, kicked out of their home, or denied other rights for being a member of the LGBTQ+ community to fight back with litigation;\n   * Overturning the discriminatory adoption bill my opponent helped pass; and\n   * Expanding the Equal Pay Act, as done in Washington ([**https://www.fisherphillips.com/resources-alerts-equal-pay-for-equal-work-washington-updates**](https://www.fisherphillips.com/resources-alerts-equal-pay-for-equal-work-washington-updates))\n* Fully funding education\n   * That includes adding universal pre-K and restoring state funding to K-12 and higher education\n* As for my campaign, I\u2019m rejecting all PAC money. That way, when elected, I will be beholden only to my constituents, and not the toxic special interest, corporate money that played such a major role in landing us where we are today.\n   * On that note, if you have any policy priorities or concerns you want taken to the capitol, I\u2019m all ears.

After about a year the police let us pick new laptops and a new xBox from the unclaimed stolen items. I ended up with a much better laptop than my original. \n\nSo my advice. Get a big ass lock for your bike. Spend the $10 a month for renters insurance. Take pictures of everything over $20 and email them to your insurance agent. Then create a google drive and upload the pictures there for safe keeping. \n",

The showers had two curtains. You step in and the first area had a little bench to put your shit on and hang your towel and then you would pass the next curtain into the actual shower. The actual shower area is just a square so it was fairly small. The showers were pretty good quality though. With guys waiting for a shower was rarely ever an issue in the morning.

It's been about 5 years since I was on campus full time, and now I'm just back for football games. But I never felt any type of real animosity or hatred between anyone really on campus.  Everyone I saw was always friendly and the only time I saw people upset at one another was confrontations between drivers and walkers on campus. Maybe things have changed but I find it hard to believe that anyone really feels scared unless it's do to an individual(like personal beef or ex partner)that they have a past with.  Especially someone saying they feel afraid being black on campus when they are light skinned enough to be marked as white by a law enforcement officer.  ",

The quote was:\n\n\u201cJonathan Peuchen, speaker of the student senate and senior in mechanical engineering, was present with Kelly for the follow-up phone call from Schrag. Peuchen said Kelly\u2019s fear of harassment was \u201crational\u201d and that Kelly had spent the night of Oct. 19 in the Student Governing Association office.\u201d\n\nUnless I missed something in the story, Peuchen *does not* confirm the story but simply says Kelly\u2019s fear of harassment is rational. It\u2019s an oddly worded paragraph that a couple questions and/or an additional story could clear up:\n\n1- did Peuchen hear the second interview?\n2- what did the officer say during the second interview?\n3 - do you agree with Kelly\u2019s story as reported in the email?\n\nIt\u2019s weird that the reporter either did not ask those questions or Peuchen didn\u2019t offer a more substantive quote.

Think the size of a prison cell (and I'm not exaggerating by much).\n\nWeren't they originally the linen closets for each floor? That was the explanation we got the year I lived there. The rooms are super narrow, but you get 2 or 3 times the built in storage of a standard room, which makes them feel even narrower. I personally would have been very claustrophobic trying to sleep in one of them.\n\n(FYI, I remember trying to use that darkroom in Moore. I don't think it had been cleaned in years, the equipment was kind of janky, and it's a PITA to have to go down to the front desk to check out the key and turn it back in. I also remember having a heck of a time finding the chemicals, because they weren't easy to find locally and the post office doesn't like to ship at least one of them.

(They estimate 700,000 with a margin of error of 900,000.)\n\nConversely, they estimate 9.3 million newly insured individuals, with a margin of error 3.5 million, placing the total at between 5.8 and 12.8 million. (That doesn't include 3.5 million young adults who were able to be added to their parents policies because of the change in age restrictions.)\n\nSo using the worst case scenario for both numbers, there are 4.2 more people insured than before ACA. Using the best case scenario, there are 12.8 million more insured than before. And using the most likely numbers, it's 8.6 million more insured than before.\n\nSome Republicans are claiming that millions of people lost their health insurance, but that's some heavy spin. A lot of people lost the *specific* policy they had previously, because it didn't meet the law's minimum requirements, but they were able to switch to an eligible plan with the same provider.\n\n[Source](http://www.factcheck.org/2014/04/millions-lost-insurance/)",

She says that predicting a loss is like predicting you won't get married. It's useless to predict because the future is unknown.\n3. She may believe that you \"jinxed\" the game in the same way that saying you won't get married is \"jinxing\" your potential for marriage. If you believe you won't get married, you probably won't.\n\nIt's not a good comparison; you are an active participant in your relationship status. Thinking you will never get married could become a self-fulfilling prophecy because you shy away from relationships, refuse to connect emotionally, etc. You are not an active participant in the football game. Ultimately, I highly doubt she was commenting on your marriage potential. You've misinterpreted the situation. She is saying that *you* predicting a football loss is like *you* predicting you won't get married.

There's also \"T\" parking which is for both student and staff. Then there's \"O\" parking which is supposed to be just for students. Essentially, I see people with \"W\" tags in our \"O\" spots all the time and not getting ticketed, while you'll most definitely get a ticket if you park in a \"W\" spot with an \"O\" tag, so there's that bullshit. \n\nIn summary, parking fucking sucks.

They just removed a parking lot to build a new residence complex, and they also pulled out some road for a \"pedestrian mall\" which so far has been largely blocked off for construction trucks.\n\nPersonally, I live right near campus, so I walk/bike everywhere and parking/traffic doesn't really affect me very much, except that people desperate for spots often park in my complex's reserved parking lot.\n\nI had an econ professor who wanted them to raise the price of parking until demand was low enough that there wasn't a scarcity of space anymore.

If I got a raise, those prices would go up. They're actually going up every year anyway, but we don't get raises so our paychecks are actually shrinking.\n\nIf the campus plan is implemented like they say it's going to be, I will probably only be purchasing a parking pass for maybe another year. They keep taking away parking on campus, and are expecting us to park in the stadium lots (which are a good 2 miles away, at least) and ride a freaking bus. If our staff IDs will get us on the buses regardless of whether or not we have a parking pass, then why even buy a pass?

If you need ongoing treatment or counseling, though, you probably want to find an actual psychologist (or psychiatrist, depending on your needs) to see on a regular basis.\n\nMy experience with the campus counseling services was not great. I had a history of un-diagnosed depression from childhood onward, and it came to something of a head when I was a freshman here. After a 15-minute appointment with the staff psychiatrist, I was given prescriptions for antidepressants and Ambien. A couple months later, another 15-minute appointment had them upping the dosage. I met with a grad student counselor several times (Possibly weekly? I don't quite remember.) over the course of the Spring semester. This student counselor basically told me I needed to learn how to relax, but gave no instruction, advice, or tools for me to use to do so. At the end of the Spring semester, I was told that I was not eligible for any services over the summer because I was not enrolled in summer classes. I was not referred to any type of counseling outside of the university, I was simply told that I would not get counseling over the summer. Period.\n\nBy the time Fall rolled around, I had no desire to go back. My family doctor continued prescribing the antidepressants for a while before I decided to stop taking them, but I have not received any kind of counseling or therapy since I was a college freshman over 10 years ago. Things may have changed since that time, I don't know. Maybe I just got the dud grad student.\n\nI do know that I probably need to be seeing a therapist, and my experiences with the campus counseling services over a decade ago have made it that much harder for me to try to find one.\n\nI will say that if the choices are between campus counseling and not getting any help at all, then definitely go to the counseling center at least once. As negatively as I remember that place, I probably would have been a lot worse off if I hadn't gone.",

Neither QB is playing well and there are major problems outside of the QB position, but for Snyder to think that they have played \"about the same\" just proves that he is either being deliberately deceitful or has flat-out lost touch with reality.\n\nBut you're right that the problems with this team go beyond QB.  The OL can't block.  We have only one P5-quality WR.  The RBs aren't terribly fast, although Barnes does well when the OL creates a hole.  We still have no identity on offense because our playcalling is completely bi-polar.\n\nAll of these things point to a failure of coaching and recruiting.  That's Bill Snyder's fault and he is not above criticism just because he resurrected the program 25 years ago.",

My heart, thoughts and prayers go to every student and family member affected!!\n\nIn my opinion, this won't stop until left vs right, stops! \"The left wants to take away ALL guns\", is the message being told. I know not all, but supporters of the 2nd amendment are afraid to give an inch, as that will open the flood gates, and all rights will go out the window. I feel like most all people, left and right, want more safe gun laws! Until the ultra left stops saying they want ALL guns to be illegal, nothing will give, because the ultra right is scared to give up any rights.....\n\nBut lets dig deep. If there are more strict firearm laws(proper term), will students and staff be allowed to carry on campus? Personally, i feel safe around those who carry, since they do have to go through a background check and can't drink when they carry! Why should people be allowed to carry? Then you can't be a victim! When firearms are illegal, you become Chicago, where firearms are illegal, yet the gun violence is INSANE!!!! Bad people go after those who they can take advantage of. Who can be taken advantage of? Those who are not armed. Whether homes, social events, cities, or countries.....\n\nWhy can't students carry? On campus alcohol is definitely a big part! Which, banning alcohol would also stop most rape cases..... Also, half of all people are scared of firearms.... They are thought of as scary and destructive. Personally, i only grew up with hunting rifles, not pistols. So i don't carry, because I  dont feel comfortable.... Again, those who can legally carry, who regularly practice and aren't drinking, i prefer to be around those types of people!\n\nEveryone wants this to stop, but what happens when all bad people are no longer able to carry? Lets say, all firearms are magically gone, forever. Poof! Then what? Knives! Vehicles!!!! Why are people doing this? Culture! Once the left and right can unite, we can stop this! The government wants division, to push their own agendas. Upsetting half their voters, not a good way to win re-election.... So they don't do anything.... But we need a culture change!!! It is not ok to hurt people when you are upset, or when people don't agree with you!! Firearms aren't the issue, culture is.... In my opinon....",

Something does need to happen!\n\nWhen gunmen know that people are armed, they tend to not attack. That is what i meant about Chicago. Guns are illegal, so bad people target law abiding citizens, who are unarmed. Same with schools, they know that no one will stop them at first.... If they know people are armed, then they are deterred from attacking in the first place! Heck, start with current and ex-military students only, and teachers who feel comfortable to carry, plus security guards that are already walking around.\n\nOn a side note, we moved from a small city/town, more into the country, out of city limits.

I'd wager there are already plenty of firearms on a college campus, people just have no idea because nobody is flashing them around (nor do most who carry have the desire to). Hell, when I was an undergrad a buddy of mine bought a shotgun at a local gun show and stored it in his room in a trombone case.

College students do some stupid things, and it's reasonable to worry about the introduction of firearms into this environment.\n\nIt's also worth noting that this new rule regarding concealed carry covers staff, faculty and campus visitors too, though granted they are not the majority population on campus.\n\nIt can be argued that in the absence of a gun, people are still apt to commit crimes of violence (or commit suicide), a gun is just another tool to do so. Granted it is unfortunately effective in those regards, but it's not like the elimination of guns prevents those things from happening.\n\nAgain, I don't really like guns all that much. I have friends that do, I can appreciate the weapon, and I even owned a shotgun for a while (sold for personal reasons). But I'm certainly not a huge 2A fan.

I don't want them only exposed to what conservative Christians want them exposed to - and that is how I grew up.   There has been a lot of talk (scare tactics) going on over the last few years, regarding race theory, LGBTQ issues, what books should be banned, how schools should be punished if they don't bend to the parents' will, the parents' bill of rights, trans sports, school funding, new transfer regulations, etc. and nobody has been able to show that there is an actual problem in Kansas, that needs dealt with - just that certain people think it is a massive issue that needs to take precedence.  Most of those have come from out of state think tanks and a large PAC funded by Koch, and Kansans' largely went ignored in committee meetings when it came to all of those things.  Electing a strictly GOP BOE has me worried that this sort of thing will continue and be catered to.\n\nIf there were actual problems, big enough to deserve addressing, I would be willing to look at it and come up with reasonable solutions to fix it.

They claim that's their \"peer ranking,\" which is illogical given that high school employees are not the peers of anyone at the university level. Another 22.5% is simply retention rate. 20% is faculty resources, which is apparently a cross between class size and professor salary. 12.5% is selectivity. 10% is financial resources. 7.5% is grad rate. 5% is donations.\n\nThe entire metric is an arbitrary mishmash of data, with no form of testing done to see if using the data in this way actually makes sense. The editors of US News simply say \"this looks good\" and that's it. Which is a horrendous thought considering in the academic world a formula with no testing done to check it's veritability is a completely useless formula.\n\nUS News is a hack job of a ranking that's done quickly to push out magazines to unwitting high school seniors.

I'm most disappointed with our WRs, outside of Price and White. They don't block well, they don't run routes well, they don't make contested catches nor defend balls. I'm not sure what Kittley can really do about all these issues to cover them.\n\nThe defense, while not pretty, did enough in spite of the situation the offense put them in. They bit too hard on those read options and that's what honestly killed us the most. Need to stay more disciplined on those reads and stick to your assignment.\n\nWhat I will give this team though? They don't quit or mope around when down. They keep fighting until the end and we had huge issues with that in the past. The attitude is the hardest to achieve sometimes and I'm glad we have it. We just need to coach these guys up!\n\nKstate, Martinez and Deuce are hella exciting to watch and I hope you guys keep running it. Great game.",

I have reached out many times to the university, but am treated as the little annoying nat that also happens to pay $20k a year. \nHere are some of my notes from this semester \n\n1) I was one of the concerned students in twitter asking for the above mentioned post over the two girls to be taken down. It took over 24 hours for the university to respond. I was also harassed in the comments by hateful individuals and one of my friends was sexually harassed in the comments. I can still access those comments, though the post is removed. OSU students were openly having a field day taking each other down. \n\n2) I only attended my in person class once this semester. Upon walking in the room, the seats were 3ft apart, but were shielded on three sides with clear plexiglass to prevent contamination. The majority of the class immediately took their masks off. Even though we have assigned seating, if classrooms get cleaned once a day, that\u2019s about a dozen students, who weren\u2019t required to wear masks, contaminating the desk area with droplets during their entire class period. If I went to any more classes, the contamination would be exponential and impossible to contract trace. I have a immunocompromised roommate, so of course I have no written statement that I personally can not attend mandatory classes, and have suffered to keep my roommate safe. We live off campus and signed our lease in January. When students walk out of buildings, they also take off their masks despite still being in large crowds, not socially distanced. There\u2019s nothing stopping students from being mask less on OSU walking paths, and two passing students get within inches of each other with no protection. \n\n3) During one of my Physics labs, the physical science building had the fire alarm go off. The first responders were a few police officers. 2 officers were not wearing masks, 1 was. They walked past students from my lab who had taken off their masks and did not enforce the mask policy. It took over ten minutes for the fire department to arrive. 1 of the firefighters was not wearing a mask. I tweeted this information at okstate and they said they\u2019ll look into it. I have not been updated. \n\n4) Myself and my close friends are not even sure how many students have committed suicide. The only reason we started finding out was because of the instance that happened at the fraternity house, as that story was publicized. I feel like OSU is covering up these tragedies as I can\u2019t find information to confirm 3 or 4 students have taken their lives this semester. It\u2019s okstates job to protect these students, and the first step is to be truthful. Awareness can make all of the difference. We need education on mental health more than ever in this catastrophe of a year.\n\nEdit: do you intend to keep this thread updated?

According to the Psychological Services Center (S. Murray Hall), they have three additional on-campus counselors. However, these services are not free, but operate on a sliding scale barring many students from accessing them. Counseling and Counseling Psychology Clinic has around fourteen additional counselors, several of them working purely as intake counselors. Further, none of these fourteen are (per the dept itself) accredited. They also serve not only OSU students, but the local community. Students receive four free visits, and then a sliding scale fee applies, still barring many students from access. One psychiatrist at Grand Lake Mental Health Center is contracted with OSU, but also serves the wider community, and services are not free. MD Live offers OSU students five free visits over the phone, but charges $99/visit after. A Mercy Crisis Hotline is available in addition to the standard suicide hotline, but these services, while useful, do not enable students in crisis to establish stable relationships with counselors, which is critical to mental health treatment.\n\nOSU is failing its students in regards to mental-health. Services are available, but are not sufficiently accessible. Students in crisis are not receiving the help they need, and the university is not directing them to substantive mental health care outside of the university. Again, this was an entirely predictable turn of events, and OSU had plenty of time to prepare for it.",

I thrive on structure but lack the discipline to create it for myself. Because of this, my grades are slipping and I am worried and, at this point, resigned to falling from an early admission grad school program.

I compared parking spots available on OSU vs. the other schools and OSU came out on top. I compared parking permit costs and still found OSU had the cheapest. OSU isn't the worst, by the hard numbers alone, but I understand that it can be hard to visualize outside of the bounds of this college. And I don't mean to say all that to excuse OSU, just to give a perspective at other comparable universities.\n\n-----\n\nI've linked the documentary I made that took a look at parking at OSU if you'd like more information.

Should AA have investigative units and punishment boards?\n\nIs this an attempt by parties who feel they have been wronged to wage a sociological war in an attempt to formalize social punishments in addition to criminal punishments?

Who\u2019s to say that a hypothetical president desantis might not then look to ban websites seen as spreading too much \u201cwoke\u201d content because it makes people angry? \n\nInvest heavily in education and the populace will have the critical thinking skills to not be radicalized by foreign influences or by their drunk racist uncle on Twitter. Ban an app and the underlying problem remains, which is an ill-educated populace whose anger about lack of affordable living standards can be easily misdirected into scapegoating marginalized groups, voting for fascists, etc.\n\nThere are legitimate reasons for Americans to be angry. Wages haven\u2019t gone up to meet inflation and more and more wealth is concentrated in the hands of a select few. Home ownership is increasingly impossible for most people as is paying rent in places where people want to live. The government doles out limitless funding on war and death but can\u2019t bring itself to help people pay for college or healthcare or a home or food. Pearl clutching about people getting angry is looking at a symptom and not the cause. Banning apps is a waste of time compared to what really needs to be done: reducing wealth disparity and creating a world where everyone\u2019s basic right to a good standard of healthy living is met",

So if a college religious organization believes homosexuality is a sin, they can ban homosexuals from joining their group.\n\nThis is the stupidest thing I've read in a while (obviously not including all the stupid stuff Trump is doing). California is taking extreme action on an entirely political matter, and I can't even imagine is legal. I mean it must be, but I can't even imagine how it is acceptable. Kansas (along with other states) doesn't ban travel to California based on anything they do AFAIK, even though they may vehemently disagree on a number of issues. Is California THAT hostile to the concept of free association?\n\n1. I realize college is a place to have your world views challenged, but maybe they want a place to discuss their own interests freely, perhaps without judgement, unless LGBT people are really just going to go there to sit quietly or agree with them if the group generally holds anti-LGBT views. Maybe the African Cultures club doesn't want a white supremacist trying to convince them to go back to Africa, even if his inclusion might benefit \"society\" by potentially changing his views. \n\n2. Again, in the interest of free association, why can't any interested parties set up a separate LGBT-Christian, etc. Allies group? Then they can control it and have the exact same right to exclude people who might be disruptive the other way, I.e. vocal disagreement with homosexuality. \n\n3. You think Trump's ban on certain countries is discriminating based on geography and national origin? This ban is doing the exact same thing. Just imagine: California university students are prohibited from using state funds to travel to states that allow this because those states don't yet agree that LGBT people deserve unrestricted access to religious groups that do not condone their lifestyle; do you think for even a second that they don't allow university money to assist in travel and study abroad in the dozens of countries that would imprison or KILL the same LGBT community? Just think: state money can't be used to support Kansas because they are so horribly oppressive! Let's just go study abroad in Saudi Arabia instead and leave those evil flyover rednecks to starve for our cash!\n\n*disclaimer: sorry if I got some facts wrong or came off as some sort of angry bigot. I just can't stand it when colleges fake their \"protections\" of things like free speech by exercising an iron fist and banning all non officially sanctioned speech, then show the world how great everything is because all this diverse thinking (in their forced, protected bubble) is opening up students to the (very explicit, allowed) \"truths\" of the world and pushing society down the \"right\" (in the opinion of a few totalitarian idea czars) path. I went to a school where not club was allowed to exist without absolute school permission and sponsorship; it was very leftist and \"new\" progressive, so there were no \"fun\" clubs and the main focuses were gay-straight (and other) alliances, volunteering, religion-related groups only in the form of cross-religious acceptance, and cultural clubs for everything not white. I then went to another school that simply let groups and clubs form and exist, preferably with a faculty advisor, and there was a normal selection. A few cultural, a couple GSA-type, representations of various religious groups, and a healthy serving of academic and \"off-topic\" groups. As you might guess, seeing the clear brain-washing going on around me (despite its merits) left a lot of resentment.",

This is simply having evidence or investigative practices that turned out to be terribly bad in retrospect but wernt considered out of the ordinary at the time. Crappy witnesses are a good example.

The victim then gets to decide whether the politicians get to receive the same deal (the same amount of compensation, the same amount of jail time). **If you were on that panel, what would be your price?**",

The point is that McDonalds was deliberately serving coffee extremely hot, beyond what a normal consumer would expect. \n\nThe court found it to be partially her fault, 20% to be exact, but still ruled that McDonalds was not informing their consumers correctly and as such would be liable for damages.\n\nThe claim was originally for 20 grand so she could pay her medical bills. McDonalds offered her $800 instead, so she took them to court. The court awarded her $200,000 minus 20% - so $160,000 and it was the *jury* that awarded her 2.7 million dollars (which the judge then reduced substantially to her final winnings of $640,000)\n\nWhat you are missing that over 700 previous cases of bad burns had been raised with McDonalds and they had done nothing to prevent further damages. That is extremely negligent. \n\nIf I order a coffee, of course I expect it to be hot and even to receive a burn if I spill it on myself. But not a *3rd degree burn*. That damages nerve endings. There is no reason to serve someone a coffee that hot and I can assure you that the coffee you buy today is nowhere near that heat level due to this exact case.\n\nThat case did amazing things for consumer protection.

Some offices have modeled their chapter housing after this model and so have the resources to do steps one and 2 and then pass it off to professional staff members for 3. Some offices let the students or grad students  handle small incidents for resolutions. \n\nThe crux of heavy drinking, partying, and hazing often happens when you can\u2019t catch incidents happening and document them when they happen.

Mr. Connell had performed previous IT work and consulting for Karl Rove and members of the Bush family (1987-GHWB, 2002-Jeb Bush). [Mr. Connell died on December 19, 2008 in a plane crash](http://www.cbsnews.com/news/republican-it-guru-dies-in-plane-crash/) shortly after being subpoenad to give testimony in Bronzeville Neighborhood Association v. Blackwell regarding election fraud in the 2004  Ohio election. News reports state that Connell was warned twice that his Piper Saratoga might have been sabotaged.\n\nConnell's GovTech was contracted by Ohio Secretary of State J. Kenneth Blackwell to design a web platform delivering Ohio's live election results from the central vote tabulator to election.sos.state.oh.us.\n\nConnell's platform implemented a \"failover\" system. When the central vote tabulator hosted in Ohio went offline,  county precinct results were routed out of state to servers hosted in Chattanooga, TN  by SMARTech Corp., a private company with direct ties to the Republican party.  SMARTech also hosted gwb43.com, used by members of the Bush admin [to circumvent official email record keeping requirements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bush_White_House_e-mail_controversy) of the [Presidential Records Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidential_Records_Act).\n\nOn election night at 11:13pm Ohio's central vote tabulator went offline, Kerry initially had a 3 point lead, precinct results were routed to SMARTech.  At 12:21am results flipped with Bush being up 3 points, contrary to exit poll data, and delivering Bush a narrow victory.\n\n[Free Press - Bob Fitrakis - December 11, 2013](http://freepress.org/article/ghost-rigged-elections-past-new-revelations-death-michael-connell)\n\n> at 11:13 pm when Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry was up three points over Republican incumbent George W. Bush. Ohio\u2019s 2004 votes were outsourced to Smartech in Chattanooga, Tennessee, owned by right-wing evangelical publisher Jeff Averbeck, subcontracted by Connell. \n\n> The vote count inexplicably flipped at 12:21am changing from Kerry winning by over 3 percentage points to Bush winning by over 3 percentage points. Overall, there was an unexplainable rapid 6.7 percent shift in the vote count. \n\n> Smartech was also, curiously, the company that handled Karl Rove\u2019s private email accounts from the White House. Millions of Rove's email files have since mysteriously disappeared \u2013 including those related to the Valerie Plame scandal and the firing of seven United States attorneys \u2013 despite repeated congressional and court-sanctioned attempts to review them. The timing of Connell\u2019s accident was very suspicious. \n\n> The prior month, on the day before the 2008 November election, Ohio attorneys Cliff Arnebeck and this author (Fitrakis) took Connell\u2019s under oath deposition. The purpose was to inquire about his actions during the 2004 vote count and his continued involvement in IT operations for the GOP, including his access to Rove's email files and the circumstances behind their disappearance. In his 2008 deposition Connell was generally evasive, but did disclose key pieces of information that may have proved damaging to Karl Rove and the GOP. Why the vote count was transferred from Ohio to Smartech in Chattanooga, Tennessee remains a mystery. \n\n> This would have only happened if there was a complete failure of the Ohio computer election system on Election Night. However, Connell swore under oath that, \u201cTo the best of my knowledge, it was not a fail-over case scenario \u2013 or it was not a fail-over situation.\u201d Bob Magnan, an IT election specialist for the Secretary of State during the 2004 election, agreed that there was no fail-over scenario. Magnan said he was unexpectedly sent home at 9 p.m. on Election Night 2004 and that private contractors ran the system for Blackwell. \n\n**Additional sources**\n\nhttp://freepress.org/columns/display/3/2012/1925  \nhttp://freepress.org/departments/display/19/2011/4239  \nhttp://rawstory.com/news/2008/Republican_IT_consultant_subpoenaed_in_case_0929.html  \nhttp://www.rawstory.com/news/2008/Karl_Roves_IT_guru_Mike_Connell_1220.html  \nhttp://rawstory.com/news/2008/Killed_GOP_pilot_suspected_plane_had_1222.html  \nhttp://www.wired.com/2007/04/did_ohio_electi/  \nhttp://politics.slashdot.org/story/08/12/23/2128209/karl-roves-it-guru-dies-in-small-plane-crash\n\n\n**Parties and relationships**  \n\n[King Lincoln Bronzeville Neighborhood Association v.

When the central vote tabulator hosted in Ohio went offline,  county precinct results were routed out of state to servers hosted in Chattanooga, TN  by SMARTech Corp., a private company with direct ties to the Republican party.  SMARTech also hosted gwb43.com, used by members of the Bush admin [to circumvent official email record keeping requirements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bush_White_House_e-mail_controversy) of the [Presidential Records Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidential_Records_Act).\n\nOn election night at 11:13pm Ohio's central vote tabulator went offline, Kerry initially had a 3 point lead, precinct results were routed to SMARTech.  At 12:21am results flipped with Bush being up 3 points, contrary to exit poll data, and delivering Bush a narrow victory.\n\n[Free Press - Bob Fitrakis - December 11, 2013](http://freepress.org/article/ghost-rigged-elections-past-new-revelations-death-michael-connell)\n\n> at 11:13 pm when Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry was up three points over Republican incumbent George W. Bush. Ohio\u2019s 2004 votes were outsourced to Smartech in Chattanooga, Tennessee, owned by right-wing evangelical publisher Jeff Averbeck, subcontracted by Connell. \n\n> The vote count inexplicably flipped at 12:21am changing from Kerry winning by over 3 percentage points to Bush winning by over 3 percentage points. Overall, there was an unexplainable rapid 6.7 percent shift in the vote count. \n\n> Smartech was also, curiously, the company that handled Karl Rove\u2019s private email accounts from the White House. Millions of Rove's email files have since mysteriously disappeared \u2013 including those related to the Valerie Plame scandal and the firing of seven United States attorneys \u2013 despite repeated congressional and court-sanctioned attempts to review them. The timing of Connell\u2019s accident was very suspicious. \n\n> The prior month, on the day before the 2008 November election, Ohio attorneys Cliff Arnebeck and this author (Fitrakis) took Connell\u2019s under oath deposition. The purpose was to inquire about his actions during the 2004 vote count and his continued involvement in IT operations for the GOP, including his access to Rove's email files and the circumstances behind their disappearance. In his 2008 deposition Connell was generally evasive, but did disclose key pieces of information that may have proved damaging to Karl Rove and the GOP. Why the vote count was transferred from Ohio to Smartech in Chattanooga, Tennessee remains a mystery. \n\n> This would have only happened if there was a complete failure of the Ohio computer election system on Election Night. However, Connell swore under oath that, \u201cTo the best of my knowledge, it was not a fail-over case scenario \u2013 or it was not a fail-over situation.\u201d Bob Magnan, an IT election specialist for the Secretary of State during the 2004 election, agreed that there was no fail-over scenario. Magnan said he was unexpectedly sent home at 9 p.m. on Election Night 2004 and that private contractors ran the system for Blackwell. \n\n**Additional sources**\n\nhttp://freepress.org/columns/display/3/2012/1925  \nhttp://freepress.org/departments/display/19/2011/4239  \nhttp://rawstory.com/news/2008/Republican_IT_consultant_subpoenaed_in_case_0929.html  \nhttp://www.rawstory.com/news/2008/Karl_Roves_IT_guru_Mike_Connell_1220.html  \nhttp://rawstory.com/news/2008/Killed_GOP_pilot_suspected_plane_had_1222.html  \nhttp://www.wired.com/2007/04/did_ohio_electi/  \nhttp://politics.slashdot.org/story/08/12/23/2128209/karl-roves-it-guru-dies-in-small-plane-crash\n\n\n**Parties and relationships**  \n\n[King Lincoln Bronzeville Neighborhood Association v.

Brownback essentially ran solely against old white Kansan's image of Obama.  \n\nBecause elderly, white, conservative voters make up so much of the population it is nearly impossible for Republicans to lose in Kansas.  They don't run on records, on facts, or on logic.  Those don't appeal to Kansas voters.  Instead they use the word \"liberal\" a lot and run all sorts of negative ads.\n\nWhy does negative advertising work.  Because the old Republicans have NOTHING to balance it out.  They don't get objective news, they don't get a second opinion.  All of their friends echo their opinions.  Put a lie out and they'll eat it up, convinced it is true because Joe from down the street heard the same thing.  \n\nWhat type of ads do we see?\n\n* [Liberal judges want murderers to run loose.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wm0FZnUT9hY)  \n* [Paul Davis is literally Obama.](http://www.rga.org/homepage/rga-launches-first-ad-in-kansas-governors-race-few/)  \n* [Paul Davis wants strip clubs near churches](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45W50JhmTyk)\n\nThese are TAME compared to what you see on the radio, and even tamer compared to the person-to-person echo chamber that exists in every small town.  These people think they are behaving rationally using what information is available to them, but they are so isolated they don't realize all of info they get is propaganda.  \n\nThere are rational Democrats and Republicans in Kansas, but the elections are decided by easily swayed rural voters that can be easily controlled by the highest bidder.  And who can blame them.  The news, ads, newspapers, radio, TV all work against them and they'll never get exposed to another viewpoint in small-town Kansas.  \n\nInformed voters knew that Brownback crashed the economy.  They knew how his devastating cuts to education have forced schools to cut down bus routes, force older teachers to retire, or even go to 4-day school weeks.  They knew he was going to go after social issues.  But informed voters of either party are a tiny minority, and the Koch/Murdoch backed candidate has a massive lead in every election.",

You can't just go to work pretending to be white, it's part of your physical appearance.  However, with things like sexual orientation and religion, if you don't explicitly say you're of X religion or are a homosexual, no one would know, of course assuming you aren't deeply religious and wear specific religious attire that blatantly gives away your religion.  That's why it's stupid to compare racial and gender issues with sexual orientation issues.  If you don't say you're gay, no one would know.  If you don't say you're black or Asian, it doesn't make a difference, because people would know.  If we just had a simple don't ask, don't tell policy across the board, so many of these conflicts would go away.  ",

You're acting like it's this impossible thing when it's been common practice for centuries.  And it's not like tons of people have found out either, only once they come out of the closet do people actually find out the person's gay.  You're exaggerating to a crazy extent.  \n\nYou wanna know something?  I'm Jewish.  Would you known had I not told you?  I don't wear a yamulkah/kippah, I don't keep kosher,  I don't go to temple or anything, at least not anymore, I did have my bar mitzvah.  I also don't really look Jewish either, though I am 100% Jewish by blood.  Unless I told you or wore a shirt saying how Jewish I am, you'd never know.  And there are plenty of anti-semetic people out there, and plenty of people who'd kill me right on the spot if they knew I were Jewish, thankfully very few in this country.  But if I were to go to one of those countries, do you think I'd just spout out how Jewish I am?  Do you think I'd wear a t-shirt detailing how Jewish I am and scream at someone for making a negative comment about my religion?  Of course not.  Don't ask, don't tell, and it's no issue at all.  \n\nIf homosexuals would follow this practice, like they did for centuries, there wouldn't be this major conflict.  I don't care if homosexuals want to have sex with their homosexual partners at home, as long as they aren't loud where the neighbors can hear them, but that also applies to heterosexual couples.  If homosexuals want to text their partners, sext their partners, whatever, that's their choice, and I have nothing against that.  But no one has to know, homosexuals seem to make it a crusade to yell as loud as they can on top of their soap box how gay they are, and then start raging at those who don't approve of their flamboyant lifestyle.  This radical behavior brings forth reactionaries like me.  You can do your thing all you want, just keep it to yourself, and I feel the same way about zoophiles, if they want to have sex with their pet, that's their choice.  At the same time, I really don't want to hear about how amazing my co-worker's sex with his dog was.  Ironically, those who have nothing against homosexuality are the same people who call zoophiles gross and immoral, the same adjectives used to describe homosexuality.  It's total hypocrisy.  ",

I could not agree with you more that our education system sucks. That is because it is run by the government. Everything that is run by the government sucks, is wasteful, and is inefficient.\n\nAs an aside, I have two degrees in evolutionary biology from KU, and a doctorate. Evolution remains a valid origin theory, but a poor one, as it loses ground with each passing discovery in genetics and molecular biology.  And it's wrong to accuse anyone of intellectual inferiority due to a lack of zeal for it.  There's just no credible evidence that natural selection has the power to change species from one to another. The problem in academia is the silencing of those who challenge ANY theory on scientific grounds, and currently, any scientist who dares challenge evolutionary theory is eviscerated, a regression to treatment of scientists during the scientific revolution.  Evolution just may be shown to be the biggest hoax of our time.  The fervor with which evolution opponents (even atheist opponents) are silenced rather than debated, smacks of Copernicus' treatment when he dared challenge geocentric theory and suggested that the earth might actually revolve around the sun. You know, 99% of scientists disagreed with him. But truth has a way of being discovered no matter what zealots do.\n\nEdit:typo correction",

The class sort of took a bated breath to see where he was going with it, but the tension died down, and the lecture was alright after that point. I didn't hear anyone complain on the way out.\n\nThe next week the prof started by mentioning that he'd gotten an anonymous email the week before from a concerned student. It read something along the lines of, 'I know you didn't mean any harm in saying that word, but it made me uncomfortable. It made me want to stand up and walk out, but I was worried everyone would see and I didn't want to be the person who couldn't handle it. So I wanted to ask why you thought it was appropriate to use that word, which I'm sure made more people than just myself uncomfortable.'\n\nMy professor handled the response well, I believe. He started by apologizing. He admitted it was probably wrong to use a word like that, which has so much power, and made a promise not to use it again if it made students uncomfortable. He extended an invitation to the anonymous sender of the email, to come talk to him after class so he could apologize in person. And then he began his lecture on the history of that word, and how it got its power, and what we can learn about the history of racial oppression from its roots in American Slavery (the n-word was first used, according to the OED, in 1776); he talked about the power that words have, and why it's important we use and understand them. I'm white, so I can't really speak for any of the black students in my class, but I personally thought he couldn't have handled it better; and I'm of the opinion that it's a word which shouldn't be used in any context, unless absolutely necessary.",

The Obama administration's Dear Colleague letter from 2011 got colleges to throw out students accused of sexual assault on a 'preponderance of evidence standard', where you face a tribunal of professors and students instead of a police investigation.  \n\nThe oldest cases have now made it to the federal courts and thank God the federal judges are having none of it.  Accusations should never be enough to end someone's life or career, and if a university is not equipped to figure out if a stabbing occurred, it is not equipped to figure out if a sexual assault occurred.  That's the business of the police.  It's McCarthyism. \n\nAgain, I love the liberals.  Can't stand the progressives.  They've done real damage to the universities. ",

It is, rather, a public charge that the speaker has done something objectively wrong. It is a demand that the speaker apologize or be punished by some authority for committing an offense.\n\nBecause there is a broad ban in academic circles on \u201cblaming the victim,\u201d it is generally considered unacceptable to question the reasonableness (let alone the sincerity) of someone\u2019s emotional state, particularly if those emotions are linked to one\u2019s group identity. The thin argument \u201cI\u2019m offended\u201d becomes an unbeatable trump card.

In the process, the bar for what we consider unacceptable speech is lowered further and further.\n\nEveryone is supposed to rely upon his or her own subjective feelings to decide whether a comment by a professor or a fellow student is unwelcome, and therefore grounds for a harassment claim. Emotional reasoning is now accepted as evidence.\n",

There are also black kids who have been raised by terrible parents and in terrible neighborhoods and adopted a toxic culture.

Obviously liberty University just had to go back, and I kid you not I went there to sit outside with a friend, we weren\u2019t near a single person and we were wearing masks, and when we went to look in the huge center courtyard you could see at least 200-300 students outside without masks on playing sports and not social distancing. I\u2019m honestly giving them till October to send everyone home. I hate online classes, but at least I won\u2019t have to deal with the mess of in person classes. Oh and their official policy is 10% they\u2019re going back online and 15% they\u2019re sending everyone home.

The party spent so much money (largely from the Koch Brothers) appealing to the far right after Obama was elected, that most of the moderates in their party were voted out in favor of tea party types, led by Governor Sam Brownback. They passed massive income tax cuts which in turn created massive budget deficits. After pulling a ton of shady accounting tricks and eventually being sued by the Feds for cutting K-12 education spending to unconstitutionally low levels, they had to make up that revenue somewhere, so they passed sales tax hikes which overwhelmingly affect the poorest residents.  The jobs that they predicted would make up for the budget deficits never came, because no one ones to relocate to a state with shitty schools, roads, and a limited workforce, simply to save a few percent on their income tax bill.\n\nAll of these sales and sin tax hikes have taken place in the last year or so.  They were voted on by the state legislature and signed by Brownback.  The State House of Representatives is controlled by the Republicans by about a 3 to 1 margin and the Senate is even worse about 4 to 1.

Germany is tuition-free and suffers from even it's top universities not being well ranked internationally when a country of it's size/wealth should be producing top universities. Tuition-free also tends to solidify class barriers as universities offer less support (less revenue, more students means less for extras) which are disproportionately needed by poorer students (student housing, tutors, etc.) as well as making acceptance more grades-focused which disproportionately hurts poorer students as income directly correlates to marks. It is also economically inefficient with a 30% dropout rate for universities in Germany compared to 5% in the US, this is comparable to the community colleges with no tuition in the US having very high dropout rates. The German tuition-free status is also likely going to end in 2020 when the German states lose the ability to take on debt and the budgets become unjustifiable.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCapitalism and markets is the most effective manner to assign scarce resources.

There is some truth to what you say though, in that there are countless tricks you pick up from the old school providers that you won't learn in a textbook.\n\nAs for the stuff taught in nursing schools. It's currently a big mess. It's hard to explain but suffice to say that I've now gone through two professional licensure/certification programs with different approaches and the nursing approach is... Just wrong. It's got a lot of merit in what it's trying to accomplish, but it's just fucking wrong. The only thing that matters is the fundimentals.

It's all intertwined with this 'chip on our collective shoulders' over always being second fiddle to physicians. It was decided that nurses needed their own diagnosis manual separate from physicians.

You're proposing both violent and immediate action so you would not be allowed to speak.\n\n>at some point someone is going to make a judgement call\n\nThey already have and he is allowed to speak.

I see misinformation upvoted about fracking all the time, and it is kind of sad how little people actually know about the process. [Here](http://arizona.openrepository.com/arizona/bitstream/10150/191695/1/azu_td_hy_e9791_1979_474_sip1_w.pdf) is a paper from 1979 linking wastewater injection to earthquakes.  There are many more papers that show the same relationship, just google \"induced seismicity\", but I like that one because it is from so long ago and I think it really illustrates how huge of a disconnect there is between what the general public knows and what is known in the earth science community.  This issue has only been something the average person is aware of because of the huge increase in hydraulic fracturing to access oil in shale plays like the Bakken, which caused an increase in wastewater that needs to be disposed of. Another important point is that the water that is actually used for the frack is but a small portion of the wastewater that must be injected.  Every type of oil reservoir, even the highly permeable ones like the ones in the middle east that flow naturally produce a lot of water for every barrel of oil.  The water that comes out of oil reservoirs is nasty stuff, after all, it is essentially ancient ocean water that has been steeping with dead stuff and crude oil for millions of years, and it contains a lot of toxic stuff, not to mention being salty.  A shale reservoir (North Dakota) produces much more water per barrel of oil than a limestone reservoir (Saudi Arabia, West Texas).  Because of this, high volume wastewater injection is the most economical option for dealing with this nasty-ass water that gets produced along with the oil.  According to the [USGS](http://earthquake.usgs.gov/research/induced/) \"Hydraulic fracturing, commonly known as \u201cfracking,\u201d does not appear to be linked to the increased rate of magnitude 3 and larger earthquakes.\".  It may sound fucked, but a magnitude 3 earthquake is not much, and would only be noticeable if you were right over the hypocenter, and even then it would be some very light shaking.  The earthquakes caused by wastewater injection are somewhat larger, and in Oklahoma are in the 5-6 range on the richter scale, which is definitely an issue. Hydraulic fracturing is meant to create tiny cracks in the shale through which oil can flow,  and although wastewater injection and fracking both involve high pressure water, are not the same thing, a fact that is lost on many people.  This is not to say that it isn't a problem, however.  We just need to find a way to either dispose of the wastewater some other way, or find a way to determine with a large degree of accuracy which formations can be injected into without inducing seismicity, which we are working on.  \ndl;dr Wastewater injection, not fracking has been known to cause earthquakes since the 1970's and this guy is dumb as hell ",

All of this resulted in huge health issues for hundreds of millions of people around the world. Worst yet it had an affect on people's IQ and behaviour patterns.

From Mormon scripture:\n\n>1 Nephi 11:13 (Mary) \u201cshe was exceedingly fair and white.\u201d (Historically, this is impossible)\n\n>1 Nephi 12:23 (prophecy of the Lamanites) \u201d became a dark, and loathsome, and a filthy people, full of idleness and all manner of abominations.\u201d\n\n>1 Nephi 13:15 (Gentiles) \u201cthey were white, and exceedingly fair and beautiful, like unto my people [Nephites] before they were slain.\u201d\n\n>2 Nephi 5:21 \u201ca sore cursing . . . as they were white, and exceedingly fair and delightsome, that they might not be enticing unto my people the Lord God did cause a skin of blackness to come upon them.\u201d\n\n>2 Nephi 30:6 (prophecy to the Lamanites if they repented) \u201cscales of darkness shall begin to fall. . . . they shall be a white and delightsome people\u201d (\u201cwhite and delightsome\u201d was changed to \u201cpure and delightsome\u201d in 1981).\n\n>Jacob 3:5 (Lamanites cursed) \u201cwhom ye hate because of their filthiness and the cursing which hath come upon their skins. . . .\u201d\n\n>Jacob 3:8-9 \u201ctheir skins will be whiter than yours\u2026 revile no more against them because of the darkness of their skins. . . .\u201d\n\n>Alma 3:6 \u201cAnd the skins of the Lamanites were dark, according to the mark which was set upon their fathers, which was a curse upon them because of their transgression and their rebellion.\u201d\n\n>Alma 3:9 \u201cwhosoever did mingle his seed with that of the Lamanites did bring the same curse upon his seed.\u201d\n\n>Alma 3:14 (Lamanites cursed) \u201cset a mark on them that they and their seed may be separated from thee and thy seed. . . .\u201d\n\n>Alma 23:18 \u201c[Lamanites] did open a correspondence with them [Nephites] and the curse of God did no more follow them.\u201d\n\n>3 Nephi 2:14-16 \u201cLamanites who had united with the Nephites were numbered among the Nephites; And their curse was taken from them, and their skin became white like unto the Nephites and . . . became exceedingly fair. . . . \u201d\n\n>3 Nephi 19:25, 30 (Disciples) \u201cthey were as white as the countenance and also the garments of Jesus; and behold the whiteness thereof did exceed all the whiteness. . . . nothing upon earth so white as the whiteness thereof\u2026 and behold they were white, even as Jesus.\u201d\n\n>Mormon 5:15 (prophecy about the Lamanites) \u201cfor this people shall be scattered, and shall become a dark, a filthy, and a loathsome people, beyond the description of that which ever hath been amongst us. . . .\u201d\n\nThe Book of Mormon is the cornerstone of Mormon religion. Ask any of your friends if that\u2019s true. While you\u2019re at it, ask them when a \u201cGeneral Authority\u201d has officially told all of the members to treat those teachings in the Book of Mormon as false. Or have them show you were the above scriptures are excised from scripture (they aren\u2019t). If they say otherwise, then you can come back here and I\u2019ll show you how your supposedly \u201cgood\u201d friends are liars. \n\nSpecifically, ask them where the racial attributions in the Book of Mormon by church leaders over the last 200 years have been specifically condemned. That may seem like an exaggerated request. Except, as you pointed out earlier, there\u2019s people all over the world of different races that follow the religion and read the Book of Mormon religiously. They take the racist teachings of the Book of Mormon, which were themselves affirmed by church leaders, and apply them to themselves. The church hasn\u2019t come out and told Hispanics that they shouldn\u2019t consider themselves Lamanites. In fact, the church hasn\u2019t come out and said that the doctrine that god will use a darker skin to mark a curse is false. \n\nFrom the 2003 Eternal Marriage Student Manual:\n\n> We recommend that people marry those who are of the same racial background generally, and of somewhat the same economic and social and educational background (some of those are not an absolute necessity, but preferred), and above all, the same religious background, without question. (That\u2019s from a former prophet, Spencer W. Kimball)\n\nAgain, have your friends tell you were the church has denounced these previous statements in one of the general forums of the church, where the original racist comments were made, and not in some side note or letter.\n\n> Once again the girls that bullied were not Mormons, that were native Americans (one of the 5 was white).\n\nNow you\u2019re just contradicting yourself. You said up above that all sorts of people are Mormon. That includes Native Americans, as I met many of those. Beyond that, I clearly stated that you don\u2019t have to be white to have racist beliefs, even against yourself. I gave you the example of myself, and now I\u2019ve given you scripture to back up how someone who has access to scripture can interpret it\u2019s racist teachings against themselves.\n\n>I don't care what you consider admirable.\n\nNever said you had to.",

I never once insinuated something like that. I\u2019m sure the philosophers you based your user name made a lot of progress by putting words in other people\u2019s mouths... /s\n\nQuit throwing red herrings around. I pointed out that rather than deal with the racism in the religion\u2019s doctrine, most Mormons, across races and geography, would rather pretend it\u2019s not there. Consequently, you get pockets of racism here and there in Mormonism, and you get people who believe racist things, even against their own self-interest.\n\nLastly:\n\n> the chances that they are Mormon are pretty slim.\n\nYou keep throwing ambiguous speculations around. By the same vague logic, I could say that why would a non-Mormon outside of the Mormon belt go to a school in Utah, outside of the U, knowing how strict most of those schools are, and how Mormon Utah is. But, that\u2019s not how it works. \n\nI would say it was a mistake, but up above you said that there\u2019s probably 20-40% Mormons at UVU, and someone pointed out actual stats, to which you didn\u2019t provide a rebuttal. Up above you asked for one example, and then you ignored all of the examples from scripture (which is like pretending there isn\u2019t fucked up shit in the Quran or the Bible, or any other ideological document that people use to justify evil). Also, your rebuttal to a fairly recent religion manual is superficial. Any Mormon who has attended an institute of religion or any one of the BYUs would recognize that a manual like that was used in required courses.\n\nI\u2019m not going to debate anymore, since either you can\u2019t handle the logic or aren\u2019t debating in good faith. Honestly, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if you\u2019re just a Mormon pretending to be a non-believer, because you\u2019re answering with some FairMormon level logic.\n\nBut my argument depends on reason, so who you are doesn\u2019t matter. You either don\u2019t know what the fuck you\u2019re talking about, or you\u2019re not really about honest debate; probably both.\n\nEdit: a non-Mormon, you\u2019re",

It should be cheap. What costs are associated? Hardly any. No reason at all to charge 800 dollars, it's just a pay wall to keep the poor from getting them.\n\nYou can't mandate any sort of training before buying a gun, because that would require proof of your training, which would be a registry. On top of that being a big no-go, what many people don't realize is that a federal registry has been actually *illegal* for several decades now (I think it was part of the 1968 GCA to help it pass). The fears about slippery slope training requirements are well-founded, so what you need to do is find a way to train people on gun use in a way that is:\n\n1) Not going to cost money.\n\n2) Not establish a registry.\n\n3) Not be prone to 'slippery slope' training requirements.\n\n4) Not be prone to institutional discrimination.\n\nThe best way to do this is to have a series of gun safety classes as part of the public school curriculum. On top of solving all these issues, it also has a nice additional benefit of reaching people who may never own a gun, but find themselves *around* a gun at some point in their lives. Since the vast majority of people go through the public school system, this will teach just about *everyone* about gun safety. After all, what good does a training class do if you hand the gun to someone who's not been through it, or they find a gun, or they inherit one?\n\nThe only problem is that this opens the door to anti-gun groups to push a school agenda that doesn't teach gun safety, but teaches kids to be scared of guns, kind of like how abstinence-only education isn't about teaching safe sex, but showing pictures of the Blue Waffle to try to scare kids away from ever wanting to have sex (and we all know how well that worked).\n\nSo mandate a public school curriculum, and allow only the NRA to teach the classes. Despite what the 'far left' wants to think, the NRA actually runs very sensible and very effective training programs, and frankly they're the only organization I trust to have hands on this.\n\nThe way I see it, you need three major points.\n\nAt very young ages, the gun safety class (think first, second, third grade) is 'abstinence only' and is what the NRA already teaches in the Eddie Eagle program - if you find a gun, don't touch it! If you see someone with a gun, get the hell out! Tell an adult! This training has proven to actually be effective, ironically in an ABC hitpiece they put on to try to show how the training doesn't work.\n\nAround sixth grade, they should be taught basic gun stuff. Keep in mind that this is around the same age that you'll do pellet gun shooting in the boy scouts. This is also the age that kids will start going out on hunting trips with dad and Uncle Don and Skeeter. Put markmanship in the PE curriculum, and hey, this gives you the added benefit of seeing what kids are irresponsible fucks so their parents can fix them.\n\nThe last stage should be part of the high school senior curriculum, and it's where you go to a classroom and you're taught how to load, unload, clear, disassemble, clean, and reassemble a trainer gun. The reason is because within one year of 12th grade, almost all students will be legal adults and be allowed to own a gun.\n\nTadah, training for the masses.\n\nUnfortunately this won't fly, because the \"progressives\" will start shouting about 'Joe Camel' and how the NRA wants to indoctrinate our children and teach them to be school shooters.",

Mental health is a touchy subject here in the states and resources could be better allocated for it, I agree 100%. But i will say it's slowly getting better. \n\nThe biggest problem in America is we're very egocentric. Our country dominates international headlines so much that we see ourselves as the center of the world, which doesn't give us a whole lot of empathy or context or intelligence on a lot of issues. We're terrible at geography and geopolitics and we deal in absolutes because hey, if I believe X then X is the truth and everything else is false. It's a national attitude that's really poisonous and it's fed by our shitty news media cycle. This shitty attitude of exceptionalism permeates into a lot of areas of life. \n\nI really hope it goes away soon with more education, bc its seriously one of the most frustrating things about living in the USA. And to tie it back to the intial point (i digressed like crazy in this comment hah) mental health is seen by us as a low priority because the majority of people don't prioritize it because it doesn't affect them acutely. We freak out over the symptoms but rarely get down to the real causes.",

In short, the meaning of \"infringed\" does not forbid state or federal governments from passing *any* of those proposed laws. \n\nAlso, the 2nd Amendment was written at a time when the most advanced weaponry required a ramrod and a lead ball. Do you actually think that our forefathers were thinking about Columbine or Sandy Hook back in 1776? Of course not. Laws are meant to be changed when their context no longer applies. I have no problem with everyone owning a musket, but I certainly have a problem with you owning a fully-automatic machine gun. Like it or not, there are such things as reasonable limits on liberty.\n\nIf you believe a law is unconstitutional, our government provides you a very real and lasting means of redress: the Supreme Court.\n\nUntil we drop the silly argument that \"there can be no laws because 'infringed'\" there's no point in discussing the matter in the first place, which again, speaks to my original point: if everything is an attack on your liberty then there is no point in coming to the table. This is a fundamentalist view and a flawed one. \n\nFinally, please STOP assuming you know what I think: \n\n>But the fact that you thought they were different means the misinformation perpetuated by the media has worked.\n\nI have fired many guns in my day. I am fully aware of the differences between semi and full auto. But I disagree with the notion that those four rifles *function* identically.\n\nThe same type of gun can *function* differently depending on how they are designed. A gun that can fire 10 bullets without reloading *functions* differently than a gun that can only fire 1 bullet without reloading. You can take the same rifle and give it a bolt-action chamber or have it accept a clip. These are not cosmetic changes, they change the way the guns *function*. \n\nTo ignore this functionality you could make the argument that any weapon that fires a bullet functions the same as any other, which is ludicrous. That is akin to saying that a 9mm Beretta *functions* the same as a tank gun.\n\nThe reason that clip size is important is that it forces a criminal to reload, giving law enforcement a chance to take action and innocent bystanders a chance to escape.\n\nIt is foolish to say that researching gun violence or increasing mental health care access \"infringes\" on your right to bear arms. They don't. All you can do is sit here and focus on five words from that page (\" bans military-style assault weapons\"). What about the rest of those proposals? Ignoring those five words, do you have any arguments against those?",

Couldn\u2019t cheer at all without someone threatening to beat us up, had to rush down to the lower section after we won because there were a few guys who literally chased us, constantly getting yelled at. This wasn\u2019t just student aged people. This was older people too. Left a very bad taste in my mouth. They then hired Kendal Briles in the off-season after shitting on Baylor about that whole scenario. Not a very Christian thing to do. So after that, I\u2019ve really really disliked tcu fans because a lot of them I\u2019ve met in real life have a stuck up, douchebag attitude.",

He\u2019s recruited Cam Hildreth, Bobi Klintman, Matthew Marsh, Daivien Williamson, and Damari Monsanto out of high school (DW and DM went from ETSU to Wake but committed to him originally). We\u2019ve recruited transfers with several years of eligibility like Andrew Carr, Jake LaRavia (didn\u2019t expect him to be a first round draft pick) Jao Ituka, and Boopie Miller who have several years of eligibility left. I think we had to rely on those grad student guards because it\u2019s really hard to bring in a freshman to run the offense. \n\nHigh school recruiting is picking up, we landed 4 star Juke Harris (top 50 player), 4 star Parker Friedrichsen , and are in good standing with others. I think folks don\u2019t realize the mess Wake Forest basketball was when Forbes took the job in the middle of the pandemic and is now finally constructing the roster so we have more guys who\u2019ve been in the system for multiple years. We only have 2 scholarships to fill so that shows we\u2019re not relying on the portal as much. He had to stop the bleeding with some one year mercenaries.",

That or we were really bad at cheating.  \nEdit: These are actually kind of interesting and some kind of funny in 1956 our football team received a public reprimand for providing transportation for a prospective athlete to visit campus other violations  \n1986: Our basketball coach apprently paid players he bought one player a car and helped him pay rent and it appears he basically paid him an allowance. He bought two different players plane tickets home and gave them each $20. An assistant coach drove one of the players home and back over Christmas which for some reason is against the rules. which is impressive because we went 5-23 in 83-84 and 11-17 in the 84-85 which is when the players were being paid despite the lack of success and minor payments a two year postseason ban  despite firing all involved and sucking  \n1995: Basketball cheated again in an attempt to find a \"quick fix\" to become good at basketball we recruiting players with bad academic records out of JuCo and the coaches helped them cheat on exams to get the required JuCo credits to be eligible. We self-imposed a postseason ban and the coach charged with lack of institutional control but the university was commended for taking immediate action when they discovered the academic fraud and reporting the issue to the NCAA and self-imposing the scholarship reductions. The head coach and three assistants were charged with wire fraud, mail fraud and conspiracy. The head coach was found not guilty but the assistants were found guilty. Apparently they were all enrolled at Southwestern Assembly of God College in Lakeland, Florida by the assistants and somehow needed help to pass rigorous courses like Old Testament Survery, New Testament Survey, Intro to Philospohy and Planet Earth. Apparently they literally took the final exams for the students on those courses.  \n2000- Men's Tennis somehow broke NCAA rules. As part of it an assistant football coach was fired for improper contact with a recruit that was reported by another assistant coach when he found out about it. The assistant football coach who was fired had the defense that the assistant coach who told him shouldn't be believed because of his race. The NCAA made sure to point out that they rejected that terrible argument even though no violations were charged against football. The tennis violations involved the head coach suggested that grad student players to use their university grad student stipend (Hey I get one of those next year) to pay for housing for undergrad players who were on only partial scholarship. Because they did it meant we used 4.53 scholarships instead of 4.5 but the NCAA concluded that it was more of an order than a suggestion by the coach (apparently the grad student gave up $50 a month but that is enough for a major NCAA violation because NCAA don't care how little money it is). Also we didn't inform one prospect from Europe that he was limited to 5 paid visits and allowed him to overstay on campus because he was taking the ACT. Also it does sound like the coach was definitely in the wrong and deserved it but the only penalties were two match suspensions for the underclassmen who received improper benefits and the coach had to attend NCAA compliance sessions, however, this somewhat minor infraction is what would lead to more severe consequences in the next case.  \n2005-Dave Bliss is a piece of trash. To open with a quote from the NCAA \"In the end, the former head coach and his assistants' blatant disregard for NCAA rules brought incalculable disgrace to themselves, the university and intercollegiate athletics as a whole.\" Yep, that about sums it up. He offered five players scholarships thinking at least two weren't going to be elgible when they all were he decided to pay for two of them out of his own pocket. Supposedly those players according to Bliss were of dubious character and according to him they were involved in \"rampant drug use and criminal activity\". When one of the two players who he was paying for out of his own pocket disappeared (he was murdered by the other player Bliss was paying for because we really screwed up), Bliss blatantly tried to cover up his violations. He told the murderer's mother to lie about how tutition was paid. He told his players to paint the murdered player as a drug dealer. Bliss also bought a Chevy Tahoe for one of the players. He also committed a multitude of recruiting violations. Three players tested positive for marijuana and the university did nothing about it (I've known kids who have been kicked out for multiple positive tests for marijuana). He told boosters to fund an AAU team that recruits played for. Baylor did a terrible job of noticing obvious violations being committed so got hit with institutional control and also would have had the death penalty if they had not self-imposed severe punishments. The NCAA still gave us a half year death penalty and we allowed all players to transfer and they pretty much all did. Somehow Scott Drew came in and turned the program into a winner.  \n2012-Scott Drew and Kim Mulkey got slaps on the wrist for making too many phone calls.  \n2016- A minor football recruiting violation. Shockingly rules were being broken by football.",

Until then, I have no reason to believe that the fix is in just because a bunch of whiny ass fans tell me it is while their teams lose. \u201cEverybody in the league\u201d is just pissy that they lose at AFH 90+% of the time lmao, let\u2019s be honest. Much easier to pretend that it\u2019s a conspiracy than to come to terms with KU beating your asses over and over and over and over.\n\nMost teams get home cooking to some degree. Obviously there are going to be bad calls in our favor sometimes, it\u2019s just not some grand conspiracy that only favors KU. Hilarious that a 3 game sample of foul differential is meaningless in your mind but one bad call tonight (the Harris play) apparently proves you correct. Also you say that Harris play was both one of the worst charge calls you\u2019ve ever seen and that it\u2019s simultaneously a normal occurrence. Your entire argument is \u201cwe\u2019re right because we say so.\u201d You sound ridiculous. Sorry\n\nEdit: also, just to state the obvious, you can say that data doesn\u2019t refute your claim and I\u2019d agree that\u2019s fair because it\u2019s a small sample size (although if the officiating was truly as corrupt as you guys like to imply, you\u2019d think it would show up even in a small sample). However, I really don\u2019t have to refute shit because the burden of proof here is on you. You make the claim that we get this favorable treatment and base it on absolutely nothing except a feeling of victimhood, but you expect someone to compile years of data to disprove it? Why the fuck would I bother? It\u2019s a laughable and ridiculous conspiracy theory.",

Unlike seasons prior, block student seating was implemented for Fraternities and Sororities in the student section, giving these Greek students preferential seating treatment over their peers. At this game, sisters of Kappa Delta\u2019s Kappa Alpha Chapter were witnessed verbally abusing and hurling homophobic and racial slurs at non-Greek black students who were occupying KD\u2019s \u201cdesignated\u201d area. Similarly, sisters of Kappa Alpha Theta\u2019s Beta Nu Chapter were documented intimidating and tormenting black students who were occupying \u201ctheir\u201d section of the block seating. I did not witness these events personally, but documentation can be found in the links below. Block seating is a form of classism that caters to those who can afford extra dues on top of college tuition. The student section is meant to be that, FOR STUDENTS. No one should be given preferential treatment for seating based on two to three Greek letters that proceed their Instagram Bio name. However, I find it doubtful FSU remove block seating as many of the most prolific Boosters are Greek and the student government would have to vote against its own interests, as most of these individuals are Greek.  \nDuring the Notre Dame game, a college-aged Notre Dame fan entered the 123-student section of the Doak. As he approached a seat multiple students harassed him by yelling insults, giving him the finger, and one even threw a water bottle at him. This charade continued for a couple of minutes until the Notre Dame fan left. My disappointment in the student body was growing and I thought it couldn\u2019t get any worse. Then a large group of students started chanting, \u201cFuck Joe Biden!\u201d This was heard a couple of times throughout the entirety of the game. I also received word these chants continued to be yelled at our recent upset loss to Jacksonville State University.  \nIt seems that any sense of civility is lacking from our student body. At best, our student body could be summed up as an unruly crowd and at worse a group of conservative entitled bigots whose lack of empathy for others will attribute to the downward spiral of this campus. It is up to those in charge to hold those individuals whose actions I\u2019ve mentioned accountable.

I would rather go to UofI if I wanted more things around me instead of going to a small town. Another reason would be that we are understaffed with money being given to both administrators and athletics, with the admins voting to increase tuition, and just filling their pockets.  We are severely understaffed with not enough professors, and the professors we have being a mix of good and bad, and unfortunately there are quite a bit of bad ones. \n\nEven when I was involved with the school government and jobs, it was understaffed and you felt like you had no power even though you were considered to be in a position of power, you could vote but ultimately the final decision would be decided by the admins. As a student worker you are underappreciated and with the measures in place to not allow you going over a certain amount of hours, it often feels like its not even worth it to work with how small your income is. When I was an RA I had no power, you can be scrutinized in the blink of the eye and the school does not have your back, if something happens you are the first to be inspected, where if you are having problems you are supposed to just take it, though you get free housing and RDA, the work you put forward often makes it not feel worth it.\n\nThe dorms are a mess with newer ones and older ones, with certain halls having favoritism, and nothing being done to make living spaces better in the older ones. For instance Stepheson East had their floor flooded and were moved to Rogers, residents were given $100 something dollars in RDA while RA's had to patrol both buildings and were given a pizza.

Whitman county has a low vaccination rate something like 40 or 50% iirc however that number does include children who cant get vaccinated yet so keep that in mind. Basically health officials are a little scared of the delta variant once students return as we are literally coming from all over the world.\n\nPersonally I am absolutely baffled at how political and how much misinformation is going around about this vaccine. As someone in the stem field that studies science I really don\u2019t understand why suddenly people don\u2019t want to get vaccinated. We were given the ability to be able to understand our world and the natural laws of it. With this we were given the ability to understand biology and chemistry on such a detailed level that we can create vaccines to save us from diseases that once wiped out masses. We are so good at making them too as we have been researching this science for centuries. I just don\u2019t get it. Science is the closest thing to the hand writing of god (not getting religious just a figure of speech).\n\nI\u2019m so tired of debating and trying to get people to understand how the vaccine works, why it\u2019s safe, and how to understand the statistics behind covid and the vaccine. But honestly no matter how much logic, math, academic studies, and science you use in an argument you really cant argue against emotion and willful ignorance, and it is infuriating. And to sum up what the ending of the kurzgesagt video on vaccines says at the end:\n\nWe can\u2019t hide from the reality of what anti vaccine conspiracies do. They kill babies too young to be vaccinated, they kill healthy kids who are unlucky due to autoimmune deficiencies, and they bring serious diseases back from the verge of extinction. The biggest side effect of vaccines is fewer dead children. \n\nI highly recommend everyone watches this video:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/zBkVCpbNnkU",

During heightened periods of conflict the US Government simply amended the requirements as needed to conscript more men. I.e. After Pearl Harbor, the Korean War, Vietnam Conflict \nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscription_in_the_United_States\n\nMore US personnel volunteered for military service and combat duty in Vietnam, than initially were drafted. Some sources say about 25% of the military consisted of draftees during that timeframe. https://michiganintheworld.history.lsa.umich.edu/antivietnamwar/exhibits/show/exhibit/draft_protests/the-military-draft-during-the-\n\n* 2: Draftees were low-class angry men, who were poor soliders. \n\nIMHO, the \"drugged-up\" and angry \"hippy\" draftee, that was willing to frag his superiors didn't really become a problem for the US military until around 1969-70.That's around the same time more prominent political and social figures started speaking out against the war (i.e. after the First Tet Offensive in 68). \n\nNow there was a program instituted by Sec. Def. McNamara 1966 Project 100,000 to use low IQ individuals to fill the ranks. Although the program has now been derided as highly unethical, the program was conceived as a social program to give the low IQ and mentally stunted people an opportunity to get military technical training and become functional members of society. The US Government would get more bodies.\nhttps://youtu.be/_J2VwFDV4-g\n\n* 3: Everyone was against the war\n\nInitially, there was overwhelming support for the war especially during the early part of the Johnson Administration. The aftermath of the Gulf of Tonkin incident (the Maddox and Turner Joy incidents). Congress pretty much gave the POTUS a \"blank check\" to commit US military resources as desired *Only **two** members of Congress voted against the 1964 Gulf of Tonkin Resolution).\n\nStrong anti war sentiment, i.e. protests, sit-ins, riots, etc. did not start happening on a large scale until the late 60s and early 70s.

During a recent exhibition of Cole J. Bros.' circus in Columbita 500 students of the university went to the circus grounds in a body and demanded admission for 25 cents, while the regular price was 50 cents. Their demand was acceded to by the circus management and the 500 students were admitted for 25 cents, each. It was a game of bulldoze and the students won their point. The act of any gentleman who didn't have the regular price of admission would have been to remain away from the show. But the temptation to play the hoodlum rooted out what should have been the qualities of a gentleman. When the circus performance had come to a close these 500 university hoodlums concluded to remain to the concert without paying for the privilege, but were finally, after making an exhibition of their I asininity, ejected from the tent. Fancying that they had been insulted by not being permitted to \"beat\" their way to the concert, they repaired to the Wabash depot where the circus cars were in waiting and greased the railroad track for some distance, removed one rail and loosened another and placed a rock beneath it. They then awaited the coming of the circus crew and when the showmen discovered what had been done a general fight between them and the students took place. One of the students and one of the showmen were shot and manv were the sore heads and bruised bodies. Rocks, clubs, circus poles, etc, figured in the fight and most of the windows were broken out of the circus train a nice (?) advertisement for Missouri's leading educational institution as the train sped across the state to Carrollton the next day. \n\nUnless a determined effort is made to bring the rioters to justice we shall believe the faculty of the university to be a craven set of cowards and particeps criminis. Such conduct by any man is a burning shame and disgrace to the state, and particularly so when engaged in by young men who are pretending to be seeking \"a higher education.\" If the guilty ones are not punished by\nstatutory law or by expulsion from the university, a member of the Missouri legislature who votes to appropriate even as much as a single dollar to the state university ought to be impeached.",

Lots of things are great!... until you have too much or too little of them. Hell, even *freedom* works this way. And sometimes a position is bad by virtue of how far it goes to one side. Or by not going far enough.\n\nThis feels broad and non-controversial enough that I'm surprised we're both still here talking about it.\n\n>But now you're saying that compromise can be effective in order to enact change.

Under this reasoning, the most-affluent blacks rank below the poorest whites when it comes to privilege and opportunities. More than 50 years of affirmative action programs and race consciousness has done nothing to change the trajectory or opportunities of people born without white skin. According to critical theory, every dysfunctional condition in black urban communities can be traced to slavery and its aftermath. There is no place for individual choice initiative.\n\n\u201cNext to that of the family, there is no influence more potent for good or evil over the lives of individuals than the associations of school days.\u201d David Lipscomb (Lipscomb University co-founder).\n\nCritical race theory is rooted in cultural Marxism; its purpose to divide the world into white oppressors and non-white victims. It uses personal narratives of marginalized minority \u201cvictim\u201d groups (black, Hispanic, female, and homosexuals) as irrefutable evidence of the dishonesty of their mostly white heterosexual oppressors.\n\nWhen it comes to race, there is no way out. Critical race theory assumes that racism is permanent and affects every aspect of our society to include political, economic, social and religious institutions.\n\nBeing born with white skin is valuable property, and any notion of societal attainment of colorblindness, where race or ethnicity does not hinder opportunities is impossible. Neutrality in law and decision making is a pipe dream that can never be achieved. Therefore, the oppressive system must be dismantled and destroyed.\n\nThis flawed theory of the world suggests that race and ethnicity will always taint and pollute every decision, the result being that racial minorities will consistently lose out to whites because of structural racism.\n\nCritical race theory can create anger, frustration, and despondency among anyone in the victim categories who internalize the destructive message.\n\nMessages Matter\n\nFortunately, I reached my formative years before critical race theory and cultural Marxism became as commonplace as they are today. Even though I was born and raised in rural southern poverty during the era of segregation, I was not taught to hate white people or to hate America. To the contrary, my black teachers stressed our need to work hard and excel. I was a proud American who never doubted she lived in the greatest country in the world. Sure, I knew about segregation and the Ku Klux Klan, but I also knew change was coming. My black teachers talked about integration and the opportunities it would bring black people.\n\nAlthough I dropped out of school after finishing the eighth grade, married at age 16 and had three children by age 20, I nevertheless earned a high school equivalency and eventually five college and university degrees. I graduated Magna Cum Laude from Roanoke College in Salem, Virginia while working a full-time job nights and weekends at Virginia Western Community College where I earned my first degree. I have always valued hard work and the promise of the American Dream.\n\nWhen I made my way to college, white teachers and mentors encouraged me to continue my education. They steered me into academia, where I excelled. No one around me encouraged me to see myself as a victim. I never fixated on the fact that I was black, poor, and female in a majority white milieu. I doubt I would have achieved success had I been exposed to the negative messages we send white and black children today. I think it is disgraceful how we teach children to view each other with suspicion and distrust.\n\nWhat takes place now in educational settings is a shaming and emasculation of white children, especially boys. Black children are encouraged to identify as victims and to organize themselves into separate racial categories.\nThat gives us black student unions and organizations such as Black Lives Matter that insist it is hate speech to argue All Lives Matter.\n\nIt is unfortunate that these negative messages fostering division have not only encompassed university campuses but are now flourishing in K-12 Christian schools. One white student at Lipscomb Academy in Nashville reported to his parents that he was barred from entering the library because the Black Student Union was meeting there.\n\nMany of the black children who attend private Christian academies are on scholarships paid for by white people, yet the race agenda and harbingers of gloom and doom tell them that white racism is harming them. There can be no grounds for gratitude and forgiveness.\n\nWhen I look out on the horizon, I view race relations from the perspective of a black woman who believes in God\u2019s providence and the prospect of racial reconciliation that comes from forgiveness and the application of New Testament principles. It is time for us to rediscover the Golden Rule (to do unto others as you would have them do unto you). I believe this would go a long way toward bringing understanding to people of goodwill regardless of their race or religious background.\n\nIt is important to keep in mind that today\u2019s Americans are not responsible for the sins of generations ago.\n\nFurthermore, slavery was an institution that blacks, native Americans, and whites participated in as slaveholders. Black slaveholders did not just own family members, some were in the business for profit.\n\nReligious organizations and the church world are no longer safe. It does not matter whether it is the Church of Christ or the Southern Baptists. Social justice warriors steeped in Marxism have infiltrated and begun the process of dismantling the Southern Baptist Convention (SBC). In summer 2019, the SBC passed a resolution endorsing critical race theory and intersectionality as analytical tools for understanding race in America. This is troubling because of the theory\u2019s Marxist roots. Instead of class warfare between workers and owners, Marxism always promises never-ending conflict between victims and oppressors.\n\nAccording to the narrative, all white Americans are guilty oppressors who have benefited from membership in a race we know they did not get to choose. Once the oppressor label is accepted and internalized, a deadly silencing and shaming takes place. The shamed oppressor is not allowed to engage in a conversation with accusers. At younger and younger ages, our children are being taught to suck it up. There is nothing to absolve one from collective guilt or permanent victim-hood. How very sad! But it is not too late for us to choose unity over division.\n\nhttps://americaoutloud.com/critical-race-theory-is-rooted-in-cultural-marxism/",

One required a tricky geometric inversion, if I remember correctly. One of the examiners asked him for a definition of a circle. He said: \"The circle is the set of points equidistant from a given point\". The examiner counted this answer as wrong since it should be a \"set of ALL points\". In other universities, they used different exams to fail undesirable students. For example, if the student passed Math and Physics, they would failed him/her on Russian Composition for missing a comma and making multiple \"stylistic\" errors.

The protesting started days in advance of the shooting and started in Downtown Kent. Keeping in mind at that time City residents and students just tolerated and put up with each other and Kent was a relatively small town. Protesting started with windows and fires being started downtown and that was looked at by Residents as their turf. The Druggist that had his downtown store damaged went to our Church, The Police Officer that had Rocks thrown at him lived behind us on the next street and the Fireman that had bottles and , rocks thrown at him and his fire hose cut lived 2 doors down from us. My elementary school had a bomb threat and school was dismissed and we had to walk home with Soldiers with guns at each corner for protection. There was a National Guard Camp set up on out playground with Military vehicles and soldiers staged. The entire city was under a 6:00 PM curfew where everyone had to be in their home. My Father worked second shift and had to get a pass to be on the road after 6:00Pm or face arrest. There were Military helicopters flying around the city day and night monitoring activity. So to say that residents were on edge and felt their safety, security and freedom were compromised is certainly true and they wanted this stopped. Some National Guardsman were local residents and were young kids just like the protesters and they admit they were scared as hell and at the very edge. . I will clarify NO ONE DESERVED TO DIE but everyone was on edge and the very boundaries of sanity were pushed. I still recall my teacher getting called out into the hall by the Principal and he telling her about the shooting and she had to explain that to our class. I am ashamed to say many locals for years had the opinion that more Protesters should have been shot as they were breaking laws and were told to stay inside. This shook the very fabric of the city and for years after people always made comments about the shooting when we were asked where we were from. \nDespite what I have said here I am somewhat torn on the entire event as I was growing up with the potential to ultimately be drafted and face the fiasco of that war. This tragedy set into motion the eventual end to that involvement and these protesters were casualties as much as the soldiers in Vietnam were.",

I did research on what university I wanted to go to, and the amount of crime that goes on here is a lot different than if you research crime at OSU. I say this because if you try and research how safe OSU is, you will likely come to the conclusion that OSU (campus itself) is relatively safe, and it is. \n\nMy first semester here I noticed a weird trend. On campus, there is very little crime. But if you step through that (apparently magic) line that is High Street, crime increases rapidly. \n\nSo when I initially researched OSU, it wasn\u2019t that my research was wrong, but it didn\u2019t capture what crime was like right around OSU. When I talk to my friends that are from the Columbus area (or from Ohio) they are like, \u201cwell duh! Columbus isn\u2019t a safe city,\u201d so what they are really saying is OSU is doing things correctly when it comes to policing, but Columbus is terrible. Which explains why the research I did before I came here was correct, but I failed to encompass the wider city government crime stats into my initial research. And why would I? I was researching if OSU was safe, not if Columbus was safe. Call me an idiot \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f but yes, after reading that article, I can relate to what that father was likely thinking.

You\u2019re correct when you say most people with CCWs aren\u2019t ready for this type of event, but we are also taught not to pull our weapon unless we have a clear shot at someone who you believe will kill you. A clear shot means nobody behind them or too close to the attacker. Meaning a CCW weapon does not come out unless you plan to shoot as soon as it\u2019s out. Meaning police won\u2019t mix up a CCW holder with the bad guy unless it\u2019s at the moment of the shot. Also, anyone with a CCW knows weapons and alcohol do not mix. You get caught with alcohol and a weapon, you lose your license to conceal. I guarantee students in off campus housing have weapons, and some have CCWs like me. Yet these muggings still occur because they often don\u2019t result in loss of life for either side. A mugger wants your wallet. A concealed handgun is hard to notice. The mugger never even knows their victim has a gun on them, let alone steal it. Gun theft is easily mitigated on campus the same way it is mitigated in the rest of the US, lock it up when not carrying it. Many CCWs have safes in their cars that can\u2019t be removed for when they stop in a post office unexpectedly. Most have safes in their houses so a burglar can\u2019t steal their guns. Gun theft wouldn\u2019t rise by much if at all simply because no one should know you have a weapon.",

I have no problem with protesting and acting for a just cause, which this obviously is. However, USG has again shown their overall immaturity and lack of foresight by suggesting something which is so obviously naive. The idea that we should end contracts with CPD only makes large events like move-in day, football games, and graduation more dangerous as we depend on the additional manpower to manage these events. Additionally, I have never heard of any unwarranted behavior at large university events by CPD that would suggest we should end such contracts. If we were to do so we would have to hire an unrealistically large police force and find a way to fund them, only to use them for these large events.\n\nThe letter is also talking about ending joint operations in the off-campus area and limiting CPD activity in the off-campus area. I hate to break it to these \"student leaders\", but that is not how the legal world works. The negatives that result are that jointly investigated cases of rape, assault, etc. would no longer occur or be responded to in cases of high crime volume days, which would only hurt students. They also seem to think that the City of Columbus, which is a municipality, would allow their jurisdiction to be overtaken in the off-campus area by the police force of a university, which I am sure does not want the extra responsibility, financial and otherwise, of patrolling the off-campus area as well. The people of the off-campus area are not all students, nor can an independent organization impose its own legal jurisdiction on a municipality which houses that organization. As someone who has lived off-campus for several years, I would not expect my city tax-paying landlord to support policing around their house by exclusively university police, whose resources are already stretched too thin.\n\nWhile the \"leaders\" of USG do not seem to understand the unrealistic nature of their \"demands\" they should recognize that their attempts to influence university policy are misguided and harmful, even if they are not acted upon by the university. Their failure to consult the actual student body they \"seek\" to represent when discussing imposition of these types of requests shows that they do not truly care about the student body or how their actions sow seeds of divisiveness within their own student body.  Next time they should think, stop, and think one more time before they decide that they should act without consulting the student body that they are elected to represent.",

You may have seen this at football games or other large public events.\n- CPD has a history of using force unnecessarily, [especially towards minorities](https://www.dispatch.com/news/20190821/columbus-police-use-force-disproportionately-against-minorities-study-finds). It has also been alleged that CPD is a [\"racist, sexist\" workplace](https://abc6onyourside.com/news/local/anonymous-complaints-from-14-columbus-police-officers-allege-racist-sexist-workplace). This last weekend of protests has also shown some of the worst CPD has to offer. \n\nThese are all very doable things that the University could end. \n\n- There are other police departments in the Columbus area that OSU can contract with for large events. In fact, a lot of other departments already have a presence at these large events. The Ohio Highway Patrol is the most visible, but I have seen smaller departments contribute resources to OSU at football games.\n- ~~A joint patrol in the off campus area isn't needed when OSU PD can do anything a CPD officer can.~~\n- OSU really does not need a literal military vehicle for its police department. OSUPD is not a military or pseudo-military unit, there is no reason to create the illusion that it is. Although these vehicles might be donated to the University, there is still University dollars being spent on them for maintenance and operation. \n- The University can denounce the actions of CPD. Drake's email was a step in the right direction, but he could have also included something denouncing the actions of CPD.",

But I just can\u2019t let myself believe/hope that everything will be fine if we go back to campus for the fall semester, even if they flesh out these plans to be robust and everyone adheres to them.\n\nI\u2019m worried that even if everything goes off without a hitch, we\u2019ll *still* see flare-ups of covid on and around campus which could lead to potentially disastrous consequences. I mean, there\u2019s 40k+ people that come and go from campus every week and with how bad the campus flu normally gets it has me worried. \n\nAnd it\u2019s just so frustrating because there\u2019s no good answer, or at least not one I want to hear. Could we avoid a covid outbreak in Columbus if we don\u2019t go back? Yeah, sure, but then we\u2019ll have to deal with online stuff again, businesses around there will be harmed, and the university might be put in a financially difficult place which is good for no one. On the other hand, if we go back it\u2019s just plain dangerous and there\u2019s the potential for students to carry the virus unknowingly all over the state and across state borders. Hopefully the \u201cno/limited breaks\u201d thing will solve that a bit but I can\u2019t say I\u2019m to happy to have \u201cno/limited breaks\u201d in the first place.\n\nGosh I\u2019m just so frustrated about it all.",

Second, I think that it is up to each individual college of a university to try to bring more exposure to the underrepresented field. For example, men in teaching. I do think that underrepresented genders should be pushed for in any field or study. But another factor is that engineering is constantly growing and so is employment. Teaching is a field where it\u2019s hard to get a job, so they aren\u2019t advocating for any specific gender, underrepresented or not.\n\nI also think that men tend to judge each other\u2019s career choices more (sorry if this offends people it\u2019s just an idea). Before women were considered equal, there were the men\u2019s jobs and the women\u2019s jobs. I think that attitude/view is still partially in effect today. Some people still view things that way, it\u2019s sad but true. Men might be judged by their dad, mom, grandpa/grandma, or even peers for trying to be a receptionist or a teacher. Bc those occupations were never the \u201cmanly jobs\u201d from back then. I think men might feel a pressure to work in an industry that is male-dominated.

My friend went to Case Western and discovered that they had spent $30,000 on creating an awful half-baked virtual university that he referred to as an \"embarrassment\". Case West's island reportedly costs them $7,000 a year in server costs. So, a while later I decided to look into whether or not Oregon State had something similar and, lo-and-behold, we did. Unfortunately, it was decidedly worse. In late 2016 we decided to check it out.\n\nIt appears that at some point somebody griefed the island, setting off a bomb of thousands of brightly colored lasers in all directions that make the entire place basically unusable. The layout and in some cases the purpose of the buildings is completely outdated. There are strange 2D cutouts of Plato for a philosophy 201 course long abandoned which leads to a strange room where your avatar is chained to a log and forced to watch a video on slavery. However, we changed it to a (very dated now) runescape trap remix which is likely still playing on infinite loop to this day. All I can say is I hope OSU isn't still paying for this nightmare.\n\nForgive the low quality of the edits and the dated jokes, we just wanted to post something about this place.\n\nStay Healthy!",

The data from china (not that I 100% trust it because CCP), and initial reports from Italy, indicate that 20% of cases require hospitalization, and that ~2-3.5% of all cases result in death. That death statistic comes from places where they had \"luxury\" hospital capacity ( ie resperation equipment, blood filtering and oxygenation equipment, ect). You are advocating for a reactive situation where (based on campus populations) approximately 150 would likely die even with good care. If the local healthcare system becomes overloaded, that death rate would likely increase dramatically. \n\nThere are even cases of paralysis due to coronaviruses like Covid-19 because the virus class can infect neurological tissues and cerebral spinal fluids. Let alone the scarring and perment damage that is done by pneumonia. This isn't just a bad flu, this is about 20x worse than just a flu strain. Nevermind the fact that we haven't observed large numbers of significant mutations in the virus yet(2 strains, L-cov and N-Cov). If it gets out of hand, the chance that we see a mutation goes up, due to an increased number of virus bodies in play. \n\nGo check your opinion against the data, here's a good place to start: https://www.youtube.com/user/Campbellteaching",

One of the men shot was shot again, once he was on the ground (and lived. I think it was the guy that flipped them off). A lot of the people shot weren't even fucking protesting and were random students minding their own business. You're Wrong About has a great podcast on this entire event. I had no idea that they were going to KEEP FIRING ON ALL THE STUDENTS AGAIN if they didn't all disperse, the professors literally had bullhorns pleading with students to get the fuck inside to save them. Then, they had to get the hell off campus, because it was under MARTIAL LAW and staying there would've made them complicit.

The document is not \"all about the upcoming food shortages. \" It doesn't say *anything* about upcoming food shortages.\n\nIt's about ongoing problems and what was happening in 2020. It talked about how school closings, unemployment, restaurants closing, and supply-chain disruptions made it harder for people to get fed.\n\nExcerpt:\n\n> Families out of work and newly struggling with nutrition insecurity waiting in long car lines for a day\u2019s or a week\u2019s worth of food. School nutrition professionals\u2014wearing whatever protective equipment they or their schools could provide\u2014putting their own health at risk to meet the rising demand for food in their communities. Meat and poultry plant workers suffering disproportionate rates of Covid-19 infections while facing mandatory return-to-work orders. And farmers, with none of their usual buyers in a position to purchase, out of economic necessity dumping millions of gallons of milk, onions, beans, eggs, and more.\n\n> These images tell a powerful story of the economic and public health consequences of poor nutrition, with 94 percent of deaths from Covid-19 among individuals with an underlying condition, the majority of which are diet-related.^1 They tell an equally powerful story of a food system struggling to respond to the disruptions wrought by Covid-19.\n\n> Americans spent more in restaurants than on groceries in 2018,^2 and the sudden closure of dining-out options was accompanied by a huge spike in demand at grocers. Food distributors set up to pack, haul, and deliver 50-pound sacks of flour and cheese to commercial customers couldn\u2019t quickly pivot to package two-pound sacks of flour and eight-ounce packages of cheese for purchase by private customers in grocery stores. Tons of food intended for restaurants and food service were destroyed while grocery store shelves emptied from a frenzy of panicked buying by those in a position to afford it.\n\n> Many people could not afford such buying sprees, of course, with 37 million Americans already food insecure,^3 and tens of millions of Americans furloughed or fired. The effects of Covid-19\u2014in terms of health and unemployment\u2014were disproportionately experienced by Black, Indigenous, and people of color (BIPOC); for example, among those aged 45-54, Black and Hispanic death rates are at least six times higher than for whites.^4 With 40 percent of Americans unable to access $400 even in times of emergency,^5 there was an explosion in nutrition insecurity in states and neighborhoods across the country. Grace, a food bank in Summit, New Jersey, was soon feeding 515 families compared to 100 a month earlier. Demand at Feeding South Florida, the largest food bank in that agriculturally rich state, soared 600 percent.^6 Navajo County, Arizona, is projected to have a nutrition insecurity rate of 26.2 percent.^7\n\nWhy do you think \"threadsirish\" lied about this?

So it has no resale value to the student or to the bookstore, it all goes to the massive publishers.

Scripts employed traditional nursery rhymes and fairy tales, modern cartoons based on ancient mythologies, and children\u2019s books series specifically written for programming purposes. Programming scripts included: The Lion, Witch and the Wardrobe, Peter Pan, Lord of the Rings, Alice in Wonderland, and The Wonderful Wizard of Oz.

One of the earliest writings giving reference to occultism is the Egyptian Book of the Dead, a compilation of rituals explicitly describing methods of torture and intimidation (to create trauma), the use of potions (drugs) and the casting of spells (hypnotism), ultimately resulting in the total enslavement of the initiate.*\"\n\n- [Ron Patton](http://www.whale.to/b/patton.html)\n\nMany 'children's books' (along with movies and cartoons) are written and produced by llluminati-controlled publishers specifically to be used for programming slaves. The ISBN numbers are the actual access codes programmed into the slave's internal [mind 'computer' systems](http://whale.to/b/sp/for1.html#B._Internal_Computers--Perfect_Delegation;_), and the books depict (coded/symbolic) what that specific alter personality is programmed to do.

Hospitals charge 7x what the actual bill cots to make up for all those that don't pay.  Medical error is the 3rd leading cause of death in America. Medical error kills 250,000 Americans per year. In 5 years medical error killed 1,250,000 Americans. 5 years of Syrian war killed 477,000.  That's a conservative estimate and CDC HC know this, as many cases are not reported.  Healthcare is 17% of the GDP.  Big pharma  has a deal with congress where they can charge anything they want in America as long as they provide low cost drugs to 3rd world countries. See Clinton emails and big pharma demanding WJC walk back a speech on AIDS per the agreement.  Insurance takes 20% of the healthcare dollar.  Many times they pay nothing, but negotiate the price down. Profits in HC are insane.  Wall steet has no business in HC.  In my estimate  healthcare is kind of like the Clinton Foundation. 5-10% goes to your actual care, while the rest goes  to things that have nothing to do with caring for a patient.  ",

The key is to get people paying out of pocket for routine costs.  The more people pay out of pocket the more prices must fall to meet consumer means.

Weve went in this country from govt enforced segregation to govt enforced association. A freesociety would have neither and instead would allow people to choose own their own who to associate with. Think about it though. If racism is so rampant, is it really a good idea TO FORCE ppl with govt to hire, serve, and associate with those they hate? ofcoarse not... \n\nLook, im an individualist, race matters little to me. Averages exist, but its more about individual mindset and ideology. Egalitarianism is socialist nonsense. Give me a black libertarian or conservative over a white liberal ANY day. The problem is that the socialist cancer has unfortunately infiltrated the minds of many blacks, who are simply only pursuing their own immediate rational self interest by demanding things like affirmative action and subsidies from the govt. Socialism cannot survive without leaching off of producers. Its the socialists who need the productive. This is probably not anywhere more evident than in post-apartheid South Africa where whites are something like 10% of the population but pay around 90% of the taxes - and are called oppressors by the communist zombies lol We do not need them... they need us and would fail miserably on their own. Thats why separation will never be allowed to happen... And obviously this is not the mindset of all blacks (one of socialism) - there are some great black academics that stand up against this nonsense. One I already referenced is Dr. Walter E. Williams.(you should really take the time to watch that lecture of his that i included in a previous comment) - but another is Dr. Thomas Sowell.

Have you read the Methods section?\n\nOn acquiring the sample population:\n\n>Recruitment postings were selected to capture heightened RNT (e.g., \u201cWorrying about the future?\u201d, \u201cBothered by thoughts that keep coming to mind?\u201d) and variability in habitual sleep duration and bedtimes. This included using alternative versions of flyers (e.g., \u201cAre you a night owl?\u201d, \u201cDo you feel like you don\u2019t get enough sleep?\u201d, \u201cDo you have consistent bed and wake times?\u201d) and strategic posting (e.g., posting advertisements on Craigslist, posting flyers at 24- hour stores, etc.). Participants were compensated monetarily ($20). \n>\n>Ninety-one individuals responded to advertisements. Thirty callers were ineligible at screening for psychosis, age outside of inclusion criteria, substance use, or having insufficiently severe RNT. Nine individuals were invited to participate in the study but subsequently were not included (n = 8 did not appear for their appointments, n = 1 current substance use disorder diagnosed after screening). Approximately half of the sample was female (55.8%, n = 29) and the average age was 35.6 years (SD = 13.6). Participants predominantly identified as White (80.8 %, n = 42), with smaller proportions endorsing Asian (5.8%, n = 3), Hispanic (3.8%, n = 2), Black (1.9%, n = 1), and other (7.7%, n = 4) ethnic identities. Approximately half reported being married (26.9%, n =14), living with a partner (11.5%, n = 6), or being in a long-term relationship (9.6%, n = 5). A minority were living alone at the time of participation (15.4%, n = 8). Participants reported between 10 and 22 years of education (M = 15.15, SD = 2.58).\n\nWhere is the control? Oh, it's not there at all.\n\nThen there's the procedure, which is a *single eye-tracking test battery*, where they see how long it takes for people's eyes to fixate on and disengage from positive, neutral, and negative stimuli. There is no experimental confirmation of the survey claims made by the test subjects, and no follow-up on their outcomes.\n\nThe end of the study even echoes my complaints:\n\n>Several limitations must be considered in the interpretation of these findings. First, a causal link between sleep and attentional control cannot be inferred from these cross-sectional data. The associations reported herein may also indicate that top-down attentional control deficits in the presence of negative stimuli are related to sleep disruptions. Second, the lack of a healthy control sample means that the relations between sleep disruption, attention, and emotional reactivity may not be unique to individuals with RNT. However, the choice of sample was partially based on previous evidence suggesting that the relation between sleep disruption and executive functioning is stronger in individuals with elevated RNT (Nota et al., 2016b). Third, the pattern of findings could indicate that, rather than specific difficulty disengaging attention from negative stimuli, there was a general slowing in overt attention when negative stimuli were presented. Indeed, previous studies have suggested that non task-relevant emotional stimuli may cause a general slowing of reactions (Erthal et al., 2005). Information about the participants\u2019 conscious experience of the attention tasks was not collected in the current study. It could be the case that they actively chose to look at the negative stimuli for longer periods, as this is a phenomenon that has been found in other studies (Fawcett et al., 2015). This could reflect a lack of interest or effort in performing the study tasks. However, none of the measures of sleep were associated with the number of trials excluded from analyses. Finally, this study did not have objective measures of sleep to compare with self-reports. Future studies that include actigraphy and sleep diaries may provide complementary information to supplement these findings.\n\nI guess this is hence the working \"associated with\" rather than \"causally linked with\". Still, normal people aren't going to make that distinction. I mean, there's some common sense here but this study is heavily skewed to accrue neurotic subjects curious about the possibility that they have problems. The design of the flyers suggests this and makes for far from a random sample. The absence of a control, in my opinion, is the worst mistake of all, and I don't know why they couldn't at least follow up with the test participants to get at least a slight longitudinality. Seems like a study designed to be done quickly and cheaply so that it can be used in sleeping medication advertising.",

The result is \"Night Owls\"; people who claim they don't need to sleep until late into the morning (2-4 am) and wake up at 12-1pm (ideally, often not possible so they simply get less sleep).\n\nThese people often feel like there's no impairment because most of the subjective effects of sleep deprivation (the \"feeling\" of tiredness) are sort of like safety caps; your body deliberately handicaps you to compensate for the increased wear caused by missing sleep. But eventually the body accepts that you simply cannot get the sleep you need, and that impairing you will have a useless disadvantage, so you stop feeling tired. You feel more alert, and less/not drowsy at all. However the negative effects on your brain's physical health (accumulation of protein plaques aka cellular garbage, loss of resolution in memory due to neurons not being given enough time to sufficiently return to a baseline activation level at night, impairment in the formation of long-term memories due to insufficient REM sleep cycles as your body nearly entirely shifts away from REM to the more critical NREM sleep, development of mood disorders as a result of various chemical messenger systems being depleted due to insufficient downtime for them to be re-synthesized, etc, etc) and daily cognitive performance remain, you simply don't subjectively perceive them to the same degree any more.\n\nVery few people are indeed very genetically fortunate and have incredibly efficient sleep, and so they truly only need 5-6 hours of sleep that is almost as good as 8 hours for most people, but these people are certainly a minority. It would require a lot of very lucky coin tosses with dozens to hundreds of genes regulating brain metabolism and function.\n\nAnyways, I got off track, essentially sleep studies are still worth doing for insomnia because they can notice other irregularities (i.e no change in brainwaves characteristic of extended periods of darkness at night, which would indicate a possible problem with circadian rhythm as opposed to just life/sleep anxiety) that might point to a sleep disorder as opposed to a psychological disorder.",

This is the best comment in the entire thread. \n\nDon\u2019t get butt hurt about it, but fibromyalgia is probably just a proxy for depression\n\nFibromyalgia is a disease without a purpose. There\u2019s no need for it to exist. There is no pathogen, no auto immune dysfunction and no physical evidence of its presence. It doesn\u2019t exist.\n\nUse a Occam\u2019s razor and think about it. Which is more believable: depressed people who don\u2019t exercise get unexplained aches and pains as they get older, or that there is this pseudo-magical disease that leaves no tangible foot prints in the human body that just happens to affect depressed people. The diagnosis of fibromyalgia is unnecessary. \n\nI do offer my sympathy for people who carry the diagnosis of fibromyalgia, I\u2019m sure that they are indeed suffering and unhappy. And who\u2019s to say that the existence of fibromyalgia isn\u2019t beneficial? Maybe this diagnosis has helped a lot of people in someway. But it isn\u2019t real.",

As a clinician, and just as a human being that has felt physical symptoms brought on by my mental state,  I can tell you that this is completely ridiculous. You can convince people they are sick, even causing nausea and vomiting, just by telling them they have eaten something bad. Pain in particular is extremely susceptible to your mental state. Soldiers having suffered horrible injuries have reported little pain when they knew they were leaving the battlefield alive for good. You actually think that it is so far fetched that to think some people amplify their sensation of pain to the point it becomes pathological? Do you think the entirety of medecine has to be solved before we consider that possibility? Because I dont see any other way to interpret your position on \"somatoform\" diseases. \n\nFurthermore, your historical examples are meaningless. Basically the old \"science has been wrong before\" fallacy. I could respond that mental diseases at some point were thought to have a basis in \"bad humors\" or that symptoms of psychiatric disorders were thought originate in the uterus in women. That says absolutely nothing about current day medecine. And, as I have stated, I am totally open to any new information about the cause of fibromyalgia.\n\nAnd you can talk about strawmanning all you want with the examples I mentioned, which were more dramatic, but still raised a pertinent point you conveniently chose to ignore about the way medecine functions because then mention \"ignoring the patient\" and lobotomy as examples of treatment, when I specifically mentioned behavioral therapy. You seem to be the one who stigmatizes mental disease there. \n\nThe traits I am referring to are not \"the refusal to accept they suffer from a mental disease\". To sum it up, I would say that they tend to focus extensively on any little annoyance in their daily lives. This does not seem to be the case in other rheumatologic diseases. Of course that is just one personal opinion (although shared by many who work with them) but I have seen enough that it definitely influences my opinion on the subject. ",

That said, there has been nothing short of a revolution in thinking about casualty using observational data. There is finally a coherent methodology of expressing causal relationship using mathematics (i.e. causal graphs formalized in Judea Pearls do-calculus) which was lacking in the earlier statistics work.\n\nSo we now can much more precisely ask and formulate tests of causal hypotheses, even with observational data. The techniques used include instrumental variables, natural experiments, differences-in-differences, etc. You can get an educated layperson's explanation in Angrist and Pischke's Mostly Harmless Econometrics or Morgan and Winship's Counterfactuals and Causal Inference. More advanced treatment is given in Pearl's own book, Causality. It's too bad they don't teach more undergraduates these methods.\n\nAs a tangible example, look at the classic Krueger and Dale study in QJE from 2002. ([https://cdn.theatlantic.com/static/mt/assets/business/dalekrueger\\_More\\_Selective\\_College.pdf](https://cdn.theatlantic.com/static/mt/assets/business/dalekrueger_More_Selective_College.pdf)) They look at the question of whether attending an elite college will increase future earnings. You can't simply throw in various control variables such as SAT scores, high school grades, demographics, etc. since there might be some unobserved (to the researcher) characteristics that the college admissions officers used which is correlated to future earnings. What Krueger and Dale do is to look at students who were admitted to elite schools but decide NOT to attend. That makes it much harder to make the omitted variables argument. Obviously there are caveats with the analysis and the study prompted much follow-up research (including from Dale and Krueger).\n\nI encourage you to look at the materials I mentioned. We can't do randomized controlled experiments in many social science settings, but we are far from the situation you describe where it's hopeless since we can't manipulate independent variables.\n\nEven your field of psychology, where the standards of research and statistical methodology, sadly, have been woefully low, there has been a realization of the need for more attention to statistical methodology.

Yes, arable land will probably be lost on net, globally, but increased CO2 concentrations actually have a [very significantly positive effect on crop yields.](https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2016/nasa-study-rising-carbon-dioxide-levels-will-help-and-hurt-crops)\n\n>The results were synthesized from an ensemble of 30 simulations produced by six global crop models driven by climate data from five different global climate models under a \"business-as-usual\" greenhouse gases emissions scenario, whereby concentrations of carbon dioxide double by the year 2080 compared with 2000. Two sets of crop experiments were conducted: one which considered the effects of both atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations and their associated climatic changes, and one in which only the associated climatic conditions were taken into account, which meant keeping carbon dioxide concentrations at 2000 levels.\n>\n>Results show that yields for all four crops grown at levels of carbon dioxide remaining at 2000 levels would experience severe declines in yield due to higher temperatures and drier conditions. But when grown at doubled carbon dioxide levels, all four crops fare better due to increased photosynthesis and crop water productivity, partially offsetting the impacts from those adverse climate changes. For wheat and soybean crops, in terms of yield the median negative impacts are fully compensated, and rice crops recoup up to 90 percent and maize up to 60 percent of their losses.\n\nThose models still predict net negative effects, of course. But that's ignoring technological progress in agricultural technology. And we still have many fertile areas that are not anywhere nearly as efficiently economized as US farmland. Mostly due bad local institutions, lack of capital, and knowledge. But that's changing.\n\nOn top of that, I have some doubts regarding their estimated land losses. But either way, the global food supply seems to be totally fine. Localized food production may suffer, but that's pretty irrelevant. In the age of globalization, you don't need domestic production. Singapore grows barely any food. As poor countries develop (which most of them are rather rapidly) their agricultural sector will shrink. They'll be able to import food.",

I highly recommend looking into the results of the Heroin Assisted Treatment trials in the UK.\n\nThe idea is basically that you prescribe heroin, under the NHS (so, free at the point of use), to addicts and they take it in a supervised shooting gallery.\n\nThe guy in charge of the study didn't want to take the job, he was given control over it when it was a small pilot and initially wanted to shut it down straight away. Then he met some of the patients and found that they were all healthy - none of the hygiene issues, the infections and so on that is generally associated with heroin use. Many of them had held down jobs and normal family lives. He said that the difference between a street heroin user coming in to the program and someone who'd been on it even a few weeks was staggering. One woman in particular had been a prostitute to pay for her habit, gave that up the day she joined the program. He saw the results and increased the size of the pilot.\n\nHeroin-related crime dropped by something like 95% in that area, as did the number of illegal dealers. In the 10+ years the program ran, there wasn't a single heroin-related death or serious injury among the patients. Heroin use in the area did not increase.\n\nThe program was eventually shut down, in part due to pressure from the US government pressuring its inane 'war on drugs' narrative onto all its allies. Within 6 months there were 20 deaths among former patients. Within 2 years, there were over 40. This number includes the former prostitute.\n\ntl;dr the overwhelming majority of harm related to heroin use is due to the circumstances around it, not the drug itself.\n\nhttps://health.spectator.co.uk/the-case-for-prescription-heroin/",

I worry about negatively affecting my daughter since I am constantly inquiring about how she feels (she is five) and I know I am harming my marriage by bringing up my wife's past. It is not fair to her when I do this and I know it but I cannot help it. I am currently seeing a therapist and I take 50MG of Anafranil a day.\n\nI guess my question is this: Are there any strategies or treatments for Pure OCD I may not know about? Are there other medications I could try? I am better when I take the Anafranil but the OCD is still a big issue in my life. I would do almost anything to get rid of it. If there are any recommendations you could make I would appreciate it.\n\nThanks in advance!",

When it hits me, it feels like a sharp, steady pain coursing through my body. I know it's not real physical pain, but it feels like way more than just an emotional response.\n\nI'd always thought it was just another component of my OCD and tried to get treatment as such, but I never had much success nor met any other OCD sufferers dealing with the same thing. Recently I stumbled upon a few people describing a similar issue on an Imgur thread here: http://imgur.com/gallery/LrvL5rM/comment/434246397/1 However, I can't find much authoritative info online about this or how to treat it.\n\nIt hurts so much that I've been kinda shut in my apartment for the past few years avoiding most social contact.

This started for me around 7th grade when I started tweezing my eyebrows and then gradually starting picking at other imperfections, like pimples or ingrown hairs. I bleed quite regularly and have gotten a couple very noticeable and painful keloids/hypertrophic scars as a result. Usually I use tweezers or safety pins to pick at my skin; In past efforts to stop \"habit\", I have thrown these implements away, only to start picking at my skin with more damaging things like mechanical pencils and cutlery.\n\nThe average skin picking session tends to go like this for me...I'm at home and get this overwhelming urge to pick at my skin. I start by picking at things like pimples or ingrown hairs. That usually degenerates into picking at blackheads (which I find most satisfying) and then ultimately any visible pore, skin flake, or hair follicle. This can be anywhere on my body, but it typically in my face, shoulders, elbows, and bikini area. I usually am left with reddened skin that is pock-marked and bleeding mildly. It feels painful and embarrassing and is very hard for me to go in public after a skin picking session until the following morning. \n\nI have tried so many things to stop over the years and this has definitely been my hardest compulsive behavior to overcome.

If I am taking 100 units spread over 5 shots per day, that would be a difference of 2 units per shot. Again, an extra 2 units once in awhile probably won't hurt you. But, using myself as an example, I use 1 unit for every 30 mg/dL my blood sugar is over 150. 70 - 140 is my goal. If my blood sugar is 120 mg/dL, that would put me at 60. Definite low blood sugar. \n\nNow, let's also look at cost. 15 units \u00d7 365 is ~ 5,400 units. 5 and a half vials of insulin over the course of a year. I do not know the self pay rate for the newer, more efficient insulin but I believe it is around 200 per vial. That's a price I was quoted when my insurance lapsed. That's nearly an extra 1,000 dollars per year. \n\nMy point being, I hope you come to understand that for type 1 diabetics, a difference of efficacy of 10 percent could literally kill them, or at least stop them from leading a healthful, productive life.

Giving the example of education, going to college creates expectations regarding what type of a job the person will have upon graduation with respect to status, salary, work environment etc. If the person ends up at a lower level position, they are thinking that they are deprived of something they should have had. It has negative consequences for well being, and health. \n\nFor the hiring organization, you get more skills, but someone who is more of a flight risk. Whether this is a problem depends on a number of things. My own research showed the degree to which the person is given autonomy, the degree to which the person fits the company culture, the degree to which the person will work with other overqualified employees (rather than being the token overqualified person) all matter.

This involved either putting me in a classroom with students that had similar diagnoses or letting me take tests with open notes/open books. I finally got out when they started pushing me toward technical school (nothing wrong with it, but I wanted to go to college). When I left the program, I was being taught math by the head football coach who had talent scouts come into our classroom and meet with his players. We did maybe 200 multiplication problems in the two years I was there. The feeling from the actions of the school I got was that I was not as able as the other students and so should be put into a different classroom so resources could be allocated to better students. I stuggled throughout undergrad for lack of study skills, but I did finish and even completed a Master of Science.\n\nMy questions are:\n1. Have you found a difference between words and actions of the school/admin/teachers?\n2. Do students in these programs tend to be more at risk of poverty or get worse jobs for lack of secondary educaton?\n3.

The fears are: 1) medication, 2) testing, 3) giving the child an excuse for poor performance or self control, 4) social stigma from peers, 5) losing even more control over the child's behavior than they feel they already have. The greater the fear, the less productive the discussion, and parents tell us they will \"try harder\" to help the child.

The goal is to work together for collective power \u201cwall-to-wall\u201d, something that can\u2019t be done in a majority union.\n\nWhat does open source have to do with a union? Does that mean their organization template is \"cookie cutter\"? That their tactics are all visible for easy dissection? I'm sorry, but that sounds very 'buzzy' with no real substance behind it.\n\nAs for minority unionism, I mean, even as a concept it's just, why bother? There's no collective pressure, no bargaining, no way to effect the structure of either organization (The union or the larger business). It doesn't create any real in roads, and should it fail, which is likely given the lack of any real direction for gains, it will sour the population towards future unionization attempts. I mean hell, given the complexities of dealing with a union in general, I could see the larger business refuse to engage either the employees or the minority union simply because the legal avenues and standards are so murky.\n\n>Because of the churn of employees at ASU it would be unfeasible to start with a 50% + 1 model. It could take a very long time to even get close to that number if it happened at all, but it doesn\u2019t mean that wins can\u2019t happen and haven\u2019t happened for UCW at other campuses\n\nAnd this could stifle future efforts should this union fail. From what I've seen there's no employee say, no voting, no representation. Just a vague prattle that \"we're unionizing\" without even talking to anyone first.\n\nAnd in the end, that's the real issue I have, I don't know a single person who was talked to about this. Not a single staff, faculty member, or even student worker. This really looks like an out side organization stood up and said \"We are representing all of you!\" without talking to anyone first. If you don't understand why that's a bad, and toxic thing towards unions in general, then I don't know what to tell you.",

If you do certain steps you will limit/eradicate dealing with severe sunburns, dehydration, B.O., sweating like crazy. etc. \n\nFor example, I see people stand or walk slow RIGHT in the dead of the sun in 110 degree weather between/on their way to class- with clothes that make them sweat more, then they show up to class sweaty and complain about the heat- while I'm chillin because I take measures when commuting to class that allow me to show up not looking like I did a marathon in Saudi Arabia. Or not understanding methods/tips to keep their body temperature down (incredibly important in a hot environment). There are many ways to combat these scenarios, ASU has plenty of shade/ Aced buildings, places to fill up water/ice, etc. \n\nBut, from what I see noone understands how hot it can get, and even if they do, they don't understand how to battle it. There is no way to completely stop you from sweating, but there are tips you can take that will limit that along with B.O., sunburns, and dehydration that people don't take into consideration or listen to.",

Of course, that won't happen until the powers that be at USU - and Utah in general - stop being tightasses.\n\nBigger picture: they need to start treating students like the adults they are. USU often comes off as a very expensive daycare for young adults, what with its restrictions on booze, overnight guests of the opposite sex and sometimes condescending attitudes toward students.\n\nAn example of the latter: I worked for the Statesman, and some university workers who we needed to use as sources for our stories treated us like we were just 'playing journalism' and that we weren't a 'real' news outlet like the Herald Journal. Really? How in the hell is that supposed to help us get better in our field so we can land  jobs out of school?\n\nPart of this condescension falls on the students too...I can't tell you how many classmates I talked to who were pissed off at student fees going up to pay for the new rec center, yet they didn't even vote to kill the hike during the USUSA elections. The school won't smarten up unless the students do, because the admin. and USUSA know that they can get away with whatever they want unless the students stop being so uninvolved in the issues that affect their wallets. \n\nIf you're still reading at this point, thanks for listening to my ramblings.

Getting to nearly 100% of people vaccinated would slow the overall rate of infection as much as possible. Second, a vaccinated population that is developing less severe effects from the disease keeps people out of emergency rooms and hospitals, whereas today all the hospitals at the breaking point are full of *unvaccinated* people who developed the most severe effects from COVID.\n\nIt's easy to make a statement like, \"I accept the consequences of not getting vaccinated\" - which of course is your choice - however judging by all the unvaccinated people who wound up on ventilators or died (see: /r/hermancainaward), you might regret not getting vaccinated later if you or your loved ones are putting out calls for prayer warriors a day or two before one of you dies.

Going to office hours is too crowded and the majority of the time as you get a very small amount of time to talk to the TAs and to get the help you need. All the time students are left without help from faculty, which is astounding considering the fact we pay for an education.  \n\n\nThe theory classes such as cmpsc 465 are ridiculous. They teach pure math with no application of algorithms. It's so theory based and poorly taught that in my class they had to curve 15%, still failing many of us. Most people did not even learn the algorithms. The people who did best in that class copied as many answers as they could from the homework into their cheat sheet and reused them on the test. Like what?   \n\n\nFinally the last point I will make is that curriculums of entire classes are plagiarized  from other universities. It's insane. For my CMPSC 360 (discrete math) professor mahfuza farooque forced us to buy her text book, which was exactly the same as another text book, except she tried to change parts of it, and left typos all over the place. How am I paying $60+ extra dollars for a text book with typos that was plagiarized from another source just to homework? Make it make sense.\n\nLet me know if you want to hear more critique. I can keep going",

Even if students aren\u2019t getting COVID at high rates and aren\u2019t getting hospitalized from it, the surrounding community is. We already saw people getting sent to other hospitals cause the local ones were too full. With the area having high numbers of unvaccinated people, they are getting lots of covid cases. One of the issues with having students be on campus is that with all of the community cases being at the hospital, there is no space there. Students are going to the hospital all the time, especially for alcohol related issues. I\u2019m not too sure of all the legal aspects, but I can imagine there\u2019s going to be lots of lawsuits or angry parents mad at the school if their child drank too much and when they needed to go to the hospital, couldn\u2019t because there\u2019s no beds left. Going online isn\u2019t necessarily to punish the students and because the school is having so many issues, but it\u2019s because the school is in a community that is having lots of issues. If the hospital(s) weren\u2019t so overwhelmed and would be able to have more beds for anything (COVID or not), then the school would be in person. But it would most likely be a liability issue now to have thousands of students there and when students need the ER or hospital in general (which is multiple a week), they can\u2019t get in because there are no beds left (which has already happened), then the school can be in big trouble",

You might get really good TAs, or you might get really bad ones.\n\nUnless you really like physics or have taken AP physics already, you'll probably hate 211 regardless of who your professor is. This isn't me bagging on the course or the instructors; it's just a time-consuming course with material that is much more difficult than you expect, and the organization of labs, recitations, and lectures is not always perfectly synchronized. I'd strongly recommend avoiding the Monday morning recitations held before lecture; as a TA for one of those sections last spring, I frequently found that the recitation activity used material that wouldn't be covered until later that day in lecture.

I am LAing for Dr. Garners section and have gotten a preview of what the new course will offer. It has more biological applications, thus the \"B\" in 112B, but I think it is an excellent course to prepare for BMB401, CHEM210, and other courses you may have to take.\n\nI had MATH141B with Simring and I can not say enough good things. His class is extremely homework intensive but his due dates are probably the most flexible on campus and he makes sure the students that engage with him get some 1 on 1 attention by walking them through problems and asking them questions. \n\nDont take Killen for ENG 15. I was the only person in my class to get an A, and I barely did. \n\nPHYS 211 at UP is just no bueno. I opted to take it at a branch campus over the summer. I put in a lot of work. Its still not an easy course, but I managed to get an A when a stressful 15 week semester with subpar professors probably would have landed me a grade far below that.",

For context, I am a \"graduate assistant\" here working on a stem phd. I make $2,216 a month. My entire compensation is provided to the university by a grant from the National Science Foundation (which PSU takes >50% of before the researchers' pay is deducted from what's left). I don't take classes; I just work. Monday, the Bursar's office informed me that I have a financial hold on my account. I won't be able to re-register until I pay what I owe them, oh, and the amount grows by 1.5% every month. Now, I shouldn't owe anything, my 5-year contract is clear about my support. So, I check my account to see that I owe $256. $250 for a late registration fee and $6 for the \"add fee\". \n\nNow, my bad. I forgot to remind my boss that I was going to continue coming in to work in this one specific way. Never mind the two ongoing employment contracts that are in effect. Do I get a warning? No. Does anyone reach out to see what's going on? No. Do I get a mandatory training? No. Instead, PSU jumps straight to extortion and threats. $256 is not a lot of money, but it is more than 10% of my monthly income. How much trouble did I cause? None, they auto-enrolled me into my one course regardless and I never missed a day of work. \n\nWhat other employer deducts >10% of their employees' monthly pay, without warning, for a very minor offense that is corrected automatically? This feels like some fucked up 1800s coal baron exploitation. This doesn't even begin to touch what our actual working conditions are like. The only reason universities can get away with this is because graduate assistants are vulnerable, transient, and easily replaceable.",

Going directly into the workforce after undergrad? Not really a big deal, go for alternative grading for a class where you underperformed. Going to graduate school or pursuing a professional degree? You might want to late drop a course and take it again better when you can perform better rather than taking a satisfactory. A couple late drops and a traditionally high GPA is going to look better to institutions than no late drops and a ton of \"satisfactory\" or \"pass\" grades. Of course, there are some classes that aren't super important to your degree and hold less weight, so those are easier to use alternative grading on.\n\n\"Satisfactory\" is a no GPA impact grade that gives you credit for a course that requires a C or higher on your transcript. A \"Pass\" is equivalent to getting a D, but again, no impact on your GPA (if you need a C to pass a course, this will not fulfil the requirement). There's also a \"No Grade\" option that essentially acts as a late drop after the fact.\n\nUse the alternate grading to your advantage, but just be aware that it isn't always the best option!",

I figured many classes are already switching to remote delivery only, which would already clear up tons of classroom space.  I\u2019m nearly 100 percent certain that the school is going to have to shut back down anyhow.  I think opening it is just a way to keep enrollment from dropping as much during this time.  This is going to result in tons of people getting sick, and tons of people dying as a direct or indirect result of bringing everyone back to school.  PSU:  do the right thing and go totally remote this fall.  The money won\u2019t be worth the cost in health and human lives.  Offloading responsibility to the students is unethical too.  PSU knows damn well not all the students will handle this in a safe manner, and are letting them walk the gauntlet just because they pay tuition.  I\u2019m enrolled but going 100 percent remote.  I hate learning that way but I hate the risk of getting and spreading covid a lot more.  PSU can keep blabbering about how much they value every student, how equality is important, how sensitive they are to different lifestyles\u2014but at the end of the day this is an institution who values the students tuition over their well being.",

Regardless, the problem is real.\n\nPublications have (not are) become the measure by which academic institutions hire, grant tenure, and reward their professors and researchers. The insanity surrounding publications is what gave rise not only to infamous predatory and ill-repute journals, but the insane cost and power behind academic publications and their parent companies. Even more egregious, in my opinion, is the effect on our professors.\n\nThe push by academia in general, and especially here at PSU as it pushes to be a Tier 1 Research Institution (but refuses to fund that...another story...) is that our professors do not have time to write meaningful lesson plans or review assignments if they seek tenure or promotion. I study under a brilliant researcher and world-renowned academic. This professor literally copies and pastes questions from a book publisher into assignments because there is simply no time. We all have problems because the context is missing and it wastes our time, and our professors, but the professor quite truly has no spare time to perfect lessons because they are pushed hard to publish.\n\nIf you don't publish you can't get tenure. If you can't get tenure, you can get fired. If you apply for tenure and are not granted tenure, you are fired. How to you get tenure in today's world? You publish.\n\nQuantity does not correlate to quality. Sadly, someone forgot this lesson.",

As someone trying to get into Ph.D. programs, it's caused me to consider to accept offers elsewhere (among other things, like claiming to want to be a Tier 1 Research Institute but marketizing it to hell and not funding researchers).\n\nA number of my professors -hate- the current situation with academic publishing and are in a position to oppose it via support of peer-reviewed open access journals.

Falling down, again, is a different risk across populations, with those 65 and older more likely.  \n\n> I find that comparing a device designed to save your life while operating a dangerous piece of machinery-to a device designed to murder, completely ridiculous.\n\nA firearm is a tool. It can be used for good (defending life) or target shooting, which is a very fun sport, or evil (murder). Don't mistake the two because they are different things. \n\n\n> Is the mentality that I disagree with. I've considered becoming an actuary. This is someone who calculates risk. The problem is people mix emotion into decisions and convince themselves that the statistics justify their opinions, self confirmation bias. \n\nThen you will find that concealed carry is not a problem. Those who have the license are OVERWHELMINGLY law abiding.  You have a greater chance of getting struck my lightning, being killed by a rapist, and getting cancer than being murdered by someone with a CHL.  The law of the land here in Oregon is this: it is 100% legal for a student with a concealed license to carry on campus, and has been for quite some time.  Though we don't advocate carrying on campus because it is against PSUs internal policy, it is reasonable to conclude many students and staff carry concealed firearms on Oregon campuses. No problems with it. \n\n> If your feelings were true on what you claim about being prepared for disaster, I ask you if you have emergency kits in your car, are you prepared for an automobile fire?

Fortunately kevlar is easily concealable under regular clothing and stops most handgun bullets. Getting hit by a bullet through kevlar is like taking a punch. If you are fit you should be able to line up a shot after that. The downside is if you get hit in the head. If you look at the accuracy of former school shooters you may not be too worried about headshots though.\n\nIn my CSGO experience 90%+ of the weapons will OHKO to the head without helmet. P90 is considered a noob/silver weapon for good reason: spraying bullets won't stop you from getting OHKOed.  If you look at pro play it's common for players to get \"flicks\" - where they turn quickly to headshot a player that came into their field of view. \n\nIf I was on a school campus while there was an active shooter I would probably not leave the room. As you said it is possible I would be interpreted to be the shooter. I would stay low and if somebody entered the room with a gun and started sweeping the class I would shoot them. That's also what I would do if the shooter entered my class to begin with. Though the saying goes, \"There\u2019s the plan, and then there\u2019s what happens when boots hit the beach.\"\n\nIn general I have to think that a teacher is partly at fault if a student becomes so upset as to shoot them. I've had a lot of teachers ranging from unfriendly to mean. In many school shootings the warning signs of an unstable student were ignored. You should reconsider how you view your students if you think each one is likely to ambush you.",

Judging by the amount of up votes, your idea isn't necessarily an unpopular proposition among the fanbase right now.. \n\nTo be honest, I don't know what the solution is.. No one does. The big whigs at CSU need to figure this one out. Here's what I think we all know:\n\n1. **Bobo is not the guy.** Everyone seems to be bringing up his health right now.. To those people I ask; does Bobo's current health excuse his *last three years* of blowing rivalry games, blowing bowl games, not instilling player discipline, blowing ridiculous leads on opponents *at home*...? It goes on and on.. It's pretty clear that he needs to go his separate way. \n\n2. **Parker should not have agreed to those ridiculous terms of Bobo's extension regardless of whether the extension itself was right or wrong.** Parker has some answering to do for this. We have to pay Bobo *$5.5 million* if we were to fire him in 2019. We simply can't afford that.. After 3 consecutive seasons of 7-6, never beating CU, losing embarrassingly to Wyoming and Air Force, why did feel confident enough in making Bobo the highest paid coach in the Mountain West? That's some ridiculous risk. Now we're seeing that this has blown up in Parker's face.. \n\n3. **Our program is in a worse place than it was four years ago, even with the new stadium.** These last four years have distanced us farther away from getting into the P5 (which should be our ultimate goal). Bobo has embarrassed us *multiple* times on national television. This has hurt our brand recognition, it has hurt our national recruiting but most of all it has divided the fanbase and turned donors away. We'll have some serious rebuilding to do. It's not unreasonable to argue that Bobo and Parker should be removed to start this rebuilding process as soon as possible. As it stands, there's a real possibility we may never beat CU again before the series ends. That's a scary thought. \n",

We should combat underlying racism and discrimination through proven methods, instead of just combating it with it's extreme polar opposite which could be equally as damaging. If all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail. Some of these programs might indeed just be a waste of time for everyone involved, and some of them could be very eye opening and informative to staff who didn't know that they had preconceived stereotypes and biases. It is 100% true that the biggest enemy of racism is education, as a lot of great civil rights activists have said. That's why we need to do it right. We can't educate people through patronizing and condescending methods, otherwise we aren't actually changing anything besides temporarily annoying the racists with the program. And it is funny to imagine a racist having to sit through one of these classes and groan and be annoyed, but is it actually helping anything, and is it worth spending money on? The money is probably better spent elsewhere if that's the case. \n\nEdit: I am not trying to argue with you, just expand on my thoughts. I agree with your point. Effective educational programs that target racism and bias are important. Also if you disagree with Trump's blanket ban on CRT educational programs go out and vote! Biden will probably retract it, though he seems to also have a questionable history on racial issues. It's just the situation when both your choices are 80 year old men who became adults and formed all their opinions in the 60s I guess.",

Reflecting on 2, even if a student passes calculus 1 and is required to do calculus 2, you could have a bad professor where you do not learn. You can have a professor who gives up on the course. There\u2019s too many situational circumstances here that it would only be fair to allow students the ease of receiving credit in the middle of a worldwide pandemic.

Look at how COVID is being handled right now for anyone on campus.  Look at the transphobia taking place by student government.  There's many examples of why someone may dislike being here.

I'll share more information as it comes in.  \n  \nCome to think of it, I wonder if the rec will close..  \n  \nEdit: got a long email from the provost\u2019s office basically saying SB extended, designated essential offices are open, no class activities should be conducted during the second week of the extended SB. I will post the full text of the letter tomorrow oh the main thread.  \n  \nOne of the more alarming things I want to share with y\u2019all from today (I have a family member who works in admissions) is that while events like talks and classes are suspended, apparently admissions office is still going to be doing campus visits and group tours (in groups of up to 75 though maybe larger). There\u2019s no prohibition right now on these groups and IMO that is a ridiculous decision when you\u2019re trying to keep sickness from spreading on campus.  \n  \nAlso, another thing y\u2019all should know (and I really dislike this move by the TxSt administration, it happened a while back) is that a lot of the custodians and chartwells folks are hourly and DONT get paid sick leave. The custodian in my building tried to come to work with the flu and wound up missing an entire week of work (no sick leave) and couldn\u2019t make up the time. Even with a doctor\u2019s note. TxSt used to have full-time custodians and paid them benefits including retirement and sick leave but they decided it cost too many $$ and outsourced them all for hourly contractors. So instead of having one full time custodian for your building we have two or three hourly contracted workers making very low wages and who are put in situations where they have to decided between coming to work sick or losing their wages. I think it\u2019s shameful than an institution of higher education that\u2019s supposed to be improving lives and making a difference would do something like that. But I guess that\u2019s borderline political and neither here nor there except to say wash your hands and advocate for those who can\u2019t advocate these things for themselves...\n  \nAnyway I will keep trying to update with what we\u2019re getting on the administrative side when I get a chance.

They're \"just asking questions, bro\" but what they're really doing is trying to legitimize extreme right-wing positions and spread hate. Giving them an audience just enhances that.

I do not speak for the University, nor am I making excuses for them.\n\nThe University is not a self-sustaining organization. In addition to tuition, the university gets a certain amount of money from the state per FTE (full time equivalent student). Over the past few years, the amount of money we get from the state has gone down rather dramatically, meaning the university has had to make up the funds in other ways, including increasing tuition, salary freezes, and simply not re-hiring lecturers.\n\nThe thing is, though, cutting classes and reducing enrollment is sort of a catch-22 situation, and I'm not entirely sure why administration thinks it's a solution to anything. The fewer students on campus, the less funds we get from the state, making the problem worse. The more classes that are cut, the less students that can be registered full time, the less money we get from the state.\n\nStudents get screwed because necessary classes are cut, lecturers get screwed because they don't know if they have jobs from semester to semester, and (some) full time faculty get screwed because instead of teaching class sizes of 30 students, they are suddenly teaching multiple sections of 90+ students. It's fun for everyone. I'm not even going to talk about academic support staff such as myself, because aside from lecturers, we're at the very bottom of the totem pole.\n\nThere's another big round of cuts on the horizon if Brown's tax measures aren't passed in November. The three solutions that have been posed to make up the money aren't pretty for anyone. It's either cut courses, enrollments and salaries (10%, permanent is the number being tossed around), raise tuition, cut courses and salaries, or dramatically cut number of enrollments.\n\nAs I explained before, cutting classes and enrollments actually hurts us in the long run because we get less money from the state if we do so.",

I was once in CA history class (which counted for either segment III or towards that local history nonsense, but sadly not both) and the professor flat out announced that he would be adding NO ONE and made all the non-registered trying-to-crash students leave.  They did, and a few minutes later, when he'd finished calling roll, a guy stood up whose name hadn't been called. The prof asked why he hadn't left when he'd been told to, and the guy said he was a senior attempting to graduate. This was the last class he needed and had been trying since his first semester to get in.  He offered $500 to any student willing to drop the class then and there (he had a laptop so they could sign on to Gator Reg) so that he could receive an add code.  He was not successful.\n\n*Seriously, why do we have UPPER DIVISION GE requirements?

You can love the unborn and advocate for them without substantially challenging your own wealth, power, or privilege, without re-imagining social structures, apologizing, or making reparations to anyone.

If people are acting sketchy, pushing it too far, and you feel unsafe or strange - LEAVE. There will be plenty of parties, you can leave this one.\n\nTrust your gut. Don\u2019t end up alone with strangers. Don\u2019t go to frats without people you trust (fucking fight me on this one, I dare you). Watch your drinks. Know your limits with drugs and alcohol. DO NOT trust hard drugs, ketamine is scary. If you don\u2019t know your limits, take it slow - you\u2019ll figure it out. Drinking can be fun. Drinking too much or too much in the wrong place can ruin your life, at least for a while.\n\nCops wait in parking lots outside Hy-Vee, AJ\u2019s, etc. Don\u2019t have someone buy you booze and bring it out to you in the parking lot.\n\nYour CA can be your friend or your enemy. They probably need the money from being a CA to get through school, and to keep their job they can\u2019t just let everything slide. Don\u2019t put them in a bad position.\n\nHave fun. Make friends. Try new things. Be true to yourself and you will find people you get along with. Don\u2019t go crazy and find yourself in a bad situation. College is supposed to be fun - you and your friends don\u2019t want to find out how real consequences can be when you are at this stage of life.

You usually get more pell if you/your family (with dependent student status) didn't make much a specific year, or if youre an independent and still didn't make much that year (obviously the total will be lower than if your family was counted, thus, more pell!) If you're 24, you're automatically an independent regardless who provides for you, is that maybe the case? SUG also has limited funds, so maybe more students were in need and it went to them first, and it ran out before it got to you based off need, given you were eligible (but if you had full tuition covered with pell, you're not \"eligible\" for SUG, which means you wouldn't be on the list anyway).\n\nYou said you used to get both, which is weird though, because SUG is supposed to kick in if at least 40% of your tuition isn't covered. I'm guessing for past semesters that was the case...based off the SUG rules. There's also a maximum number of units the SUG can be used for, but that wouldn't really increase your pell, since pell is completely separate. \n\nObviously, contact the office again and ask many questions lol.

Your gripe on when to re-open is with the administration, not Beshear.\n\nExpanded gambling was a part of Beshear's platform. As was medical marijuana, the first step towards legalization of pot in a conservative state. However, Kentucky's governor is not a king, and neither of those are in his power to legalize. So, no, those aren't things you would just \"do\", and your assertion that you would exposes how little you understand about government and checks and balances.\n\nRestrictions were only put in place when the populace at large proved that they couldn't responsibly interact otherwise. The changes under this emergency declaration have been taken incrementally, with as little burden as necessary. Hoaxer idiots who didn't take this seriously forced the Governor to change suggestions to guidelines, and guidelines to orders. And individual enforcement, as opposed to business, is near non-existent.\n\nThe Governor daily acknowledges the failure of the unemployment system, takes total responsibility for that, and frequently has the administrator overseeing unemployment provide updates on how it's coming along. Outside of the healthcare aspect of this emergency, that's been his #1 focus. And he didn't put any effort into horse racing. The horse racing industry, utilizing CDC guidelines, put together their proposition for resuming races without fans, which was approved by the Governor's office. \n\nIt's almost like you don't know what you're talking about, and just parrot bullshit headlines you pluck out of your echo chambers of choice.",

If you're familiar with 80s cop films, you can see why he's nervous.\n\nHere's a quick breakdown of how a university employee can get screwed:\n\n1. The administration of my father's school has created a smokescreen of safety theater, including totally impractical plans based almost exclusively around students engaging in totally impractical behavior. It's not physically possible to stand 6' apart when you have thousands of people moving through a single building in the span of ten minutes. Yes, you're required to take a quiz. (Sound familiar?)\n2. Students must fill out a questionnaire about their recent health and print a QR code badge to attend class. Not for the course; *for each class session.* The net result is that if someone shows up ill knowingly, they can claim it was the student's fault and put them on the hook.\n3. The university has done approximately fuck-all about prior issues like inadequate ventilation. They also don't allow instructors to send students away for an improperly fitted mask or scan them with a laser thermometer at the door. If professors are concerned, they're tasked with finding a solution to the problem via their *own* resources.\n4. The net result is that in the event of negligent death, the university stands a chance of weaseling out of any responsibility. A lot of instructors are older adults and have spouses and family depending on them, and with adjunct pay being what it is, not a lot of life insurance.\n\nTL;DR: It's a stupid response to an even more stupid administration.",

I have heard that a lot of professors are leaving due to the current administration. Seems to be a little bit of a battle of old and new ASU. The chancellor is not liked. \n\nIf you're into nature then it's a beautiful area. Tons of trails, tons of snow, you know, mountain things. I have to warn you though, if you're not into the outdoors, the magical fantasy of becoming a mountain man probably just isn't going to happen. \n\nBoone is just so packed. They didn't plan well for this amount of growth. I've said it many times but if ASU didn't exist, Boone would just be like any other rural mountain town in NC. Housing is the worst offender of all. Very costly to live up in Boone. Lack of grocery stores, hell, lack of infrastructure entirely. 20k students (and locals) in a town probably only meant to contain maybe half this amount.\n\nA lot of the negativity from people comes from how the administration handled COVID. I think a lot of this blame is unwarranted as COVID was a pain in the ass to deal with on every campus in NC. Ask anyone, it was a miserable time to be a student nearly anywhere in 2020/2021. However, I will say ASU has become a lot more cash-grabby than other UNC universities. As an example? ASU required a $200 enrollment deposit. When I transferred to ECU, it was only $100. \n\nASU is not selective at all, but neither are really any of the state universities in NC, aside from NCSU and UNC. Transfer students are a different breed entirely. If you meet the minimums (which is somewhere around a 2.0?), you are pretty much guaranteed admission. It's nothing like applying in high school. \n\nThese are kinda just ramblings with no real flow. Is it better than NCSU? I do not personally believe it is, but I am not you. I transferred to ECU for a lot of the reasons I described. Far cheaper and believe it or not, ECU has cleaned up their act seeming to care a bit more about academics. Can't deny the mountains are prettier, but once you grow up a little bit, you realize there's way more to life than your scenery.",

I budget my expenses pretty well and I made about 1,000 more per month hosting in Raleigh while cost of living was about 1,400 less in Raleigh. That extra 2,400 makes a hell of a difference. This comparison was in 2019, so housing is about 150 more now in Boone. Food is generally more expensive as well. \n\nNext is transportation. You will require a car. Anyone who tells you otherwise has friends with cars to bum. Wanna hike? Car. Mountain Bike? Car. Groceries under 300 a week? Car. There is the bus system(applecart), but it\u2019s just bad. Grungy compared to the wolf line and when I was there we were having a problem with the drivers shitting behind the bus stops. Tons of homeless people on the busses and the routes are very inconsistent. They don\u2019t get you anywhere cool either. Traffic is nuts for the 5pm rush. It\u2019s faster to just delay plans and go around 6 when it\u2019s cooled. That\u2019s shared with Raleigh though. \n\nNext the administration is smarmy with a chancellor all about the photo op. Cares nothing for anyone. Her administration is cash grabby and obsessed with looking good. University is very focused on sports. They cannot retain good professors due to cost of living in Boone and the administration pissing them off constantly. NCSU on the other hand has its smarmy advisors and predatory \u201cCODA\u201d requirements. NCSU is obsessed with being \u201celite\u201d. \n\nApp has a weed problem.

First of all there was a select group of students who were extremely disrespectful of her from day one, and I would imagine that they used the documentary as an excuse to get back at her for personal reasons. I would actually bet money on that being the case. People didn't like her because she was too real. She told us some aspects of society that I guess intruded on their comfy middle class bubble and they didn't like it. \n\nAs for the porn documentary, there was absolutely nothing wrong with showing it. If you can't handle watching blurred out sex, then you need to drop out of college. I was actually really fascinated by the documentary. My eyes were really opened to things about the porn industry that I had never even considered before. One of the main points of the film was that racism in the porn industry isn't only tolerated, but its encouraged. Basically any \"non-white\" person in porn films are depicted as the stereotype. Black men depicted as dumb beasts who just want to rape white women, Asians being called slants etc..\nI think its pathetic that the University would suspend Ms. Price for showing a freaking documentary about porn. Like the Jezebel article said, its not like she was showing \"Ass-to-Mouth City\". Porn is a disgusting industry, it does disgusting things to women, and this documentary showed that. The sad part is that if she had shown a documentary about the realities of war, nobody would have had a problem with it because America is so scared of sex but so enamored with violence. \n\nAs for her \"disparaging, inaccurate remarks about student athletes\", she was arguing that sports and education have absolutely nothing to do with one another, at least not enough to be completely institutionalized in our national universities. She argued that they were mostly here for our entertainment. On a college basketball or football team, the players are by a large percentage or majority black men. Many of them would be underqualified to be at the university, but the university lets them in anyways because they're good at their respective sports. In other words they are valued solely for what they can do on the field, not what they can do in the classroom. The already less qualified student-athlete then has less time than his qualified peers to study and work because he has to devote so much time to his sport through travelling and practices. Most of them will not go pro in their sport, so they are left with either a worthless degree, a degree that they barely earned, no degree at all, or maybe everything worked out for them and they got a good degree and a good job. She argued that college athletics are a form of institutionalized racism. I'm not very good at explaining this, but this article will better elaborate what I'm trying to say: http://www.springerlink.com/content/ypj536175017482l/",

The humiliation and threat to his tenure may be enough to set him back on the straight and narrow, especially since the N-bomb was tossed by his wife, strictly speaking, not himself.  He is the one who has to suffer through her alcohol or drug problem.  So he may be able to extract some sympathy there.\n\nThat said the university doesn\u2019t want their reputation impugned by the drunk or high wife of a professor who thinks mentioning the university will somehow endow him with extra clout when dealing with offensive conflicts.  He\u2019s not privileged in that way, unlike many badly behaved public figures we can all point to.\n\nOnce they can educate him about what is or is not appropriate, they can put him on some sort of probation, during which his wife won\u2019t do so much as poke a toe outside until they can move to a different place with new neighbors.

If this was the case, marrying a racist person isn't grounds for being culpable for their actions or words. If Ford wasn't in this altercation with his wife, would he still be held liable? I have no reason to believe that Ford wouldn't criticize his wife after-the-fact since he works at Sac State.

This is just like paying taxes, why in the hell should I be paying for social programs that ill probably never be able to utilize. Hell, there are so many redundant social programs enacted that several of them aren't even efficient or work to the degree they should be. Yet, we still do because it's for the good of everyone in the population, disregarding their socio- economic status. Everyone pitches in.\n\nNow should the fees we pay for some of these extracurricular activities be as high as they are? No, or at least I don't think so. For example, tickets for sport games shouldn't be free, but instead be at a lower cost than what general admission would be. That way fees are lowered and students are not taking on the FULL cost of running the programs. I don't know what the policy is regarding to donations and other sources of money, but the University should instead be looking at financing the majority of their sport programs through external sources.   Also understand that because there is almost no alternative route to reaching the highest level of sport competition in the US like there are in other countries, universities are the primary path for some of them to reach their dreams. Just like those that are in these programs and don't have full ride scholarships have to pay for fees on services they won't ever benefit or utilize, we also pay to help them achieve their dream to play at a competitive level.\n\nAt the same time, thinking that any or most sport programs both at a competitive level and university level should be profitable is ridiculous. Sport programs and teams rarely are profitable because to remain competitive, there is always a need to invest more and more. That is the nature on how sports teams work, and the few leagues that ever are profitable from my understanding are those in the US. And that is due to the anti-competition nature of the leagues, which in turns lets even those teams performing bad to remain in good/decent financial standing.\n\nI apologize if some of what I wrote isn't coherent, didn't have much time and wanted to put my thought on it.\n\nP.S. this is coming from someone that is paying the tuition upfront every semester with no loans.

Our official policy is when the child reaches their negative balance limit (per our food service procedures book that number is supposed to be $0 for secondary level schools but in reality our middle school is -$50 and I think high school is -$10) we're supposed to give them an alternative meal which is a PBJ sandwich or a cheese sandwich (cold, no meat) and a milk, no fruits, no vegetables. So if the child doesn't know they're at -$48 and their meal costs $3.25 they don't actually have enough for the meal. So policy is to take their tray full of food. Throw away the food. Give them a new tray with an alternative meal.... that's what we're supposed to do. And some of the schools in our district do enforce that... but I and my other cashier don't. It doesn't feel right. My school has about 40-50 kids that have a balance of -$10--$50 on a weekly basis. There's about 10 kids at our school that should be getting an alternative meal on a daily basis. What's extra fucked is that some of these kids would qualify for free if their parents would fill out the free/reduced application that I send home with their negative balance letters. I had a student that should have been free all school year, and it wasn't until I had access to student records (took almost a whole year to get access that I should have had on day 1) and could see that one of the student's older siblings was ringing up free, apparently all of the siblings hadn't been listed on the application that was submitted to our board office.  Now imagine if that kid who should have been free all year, apparently their family had submitted an application and had been approved, had been receiving alternative meals all year? That's pretty fucked. So yeah,  I at least have refused to follow that rule. Some of our kids only get food a school. Some of our kids have parents who simply don't care if their kid eats lunch. Some of our kids are in the middle of a custody battle. At the end of the day, I never assume what the kid is going through on a daily basis because I can't always know, and you can't always know by looking at them. So I always error on the side of feeding the kids because that's so much better than traumatizing them with food.",

I'm not an idiot.\n\nAnd the bill in Missouri as it's written would require teachers to refrain from talking about any sexual orientation. So if a hetero female teacher wanted to have a picture of her and her husband on her desk, that wouldn't be allowed either. And how will you talk about history without mentioning things like George Washington's wife Martha, as was the famous example in the most recent hearing? And it would make it not okay for trans kids to dress the way they choose, wear their hair or makeup (or not makeup) as they choose, because bullying would become rampant and any sign that a kid may be LGBTQ would be banned from schools lest the administration tell their parents. You have no idea the stress some kids experience from trying to hide the details of their sexual orientation from their families until they are ready.\n\nAnd you clearly are just spouting a bunch of conservative talking points without doing any real research or critical analysis. Antidepressants in teens also have a lot of horrible side effects, but through the guidance of their doctors parents are still allowed to have their children take them. Would you ban the use of antidepressants because side effects exist?\n\nWe left Missouri at the start of this year because that state is making it absolutely impossible for trans people to exist as who they are, and impossible for parents to support their kids. Trans kids have the highest rate of suicide, and parents did not give birth to their kids only for them to die because Missouri is making it okay to discriminate against them and force them to hide their true selves.\n\nI'm glad we left, and I gladly donate to organizations that make protests like this possible.",

It's far easier to remove guns in a country protected by natural deterrents like being surrounded by an ocean with very controlled ports than it is a nation with huge land borders. These nations are also relatively small. Removing and keeping the guns out of bad guys hands means the police have far more time and options than when dealing with an armed criminal. The article sites this as the biggest contributor, and is to be expected. We could start spending trillions to build moats around each state and probably have similar results, but how real is that?\n\nWith less armed criminals, of course the police can start trading in their fire arms and adopting other tactics. But in more comparable nations, that has backfired completely because the criminals had no problems smuggling in arms over their easily crossed borders, leading to terrible situations for those nations citizens.\n\nI do agree with the head restraint stuff, but you're looking at few cases where this has led to a fatality. I'm all for changes here, though, as there are plenty of ways to restrain someone without applying pressure to the neck.\n\nAnother difference in training is budget. Us training is what it is due to budget restraints and cuts. Protesters now want to defund the police, which seems sort of silly. If you want better trained police, you have to pay more for it.",

In 2014, police officers started carrying firearms more frequently following concerns that another attack could be imminent. But around one year later, amid a dropping threat level, the policy was reversed and officers disarmed again.\"\n\nNorway armed when they had an expectation of greater gun violence and only voted to disarm again once it subsided.  \n\nThey key to these nations is that they have greater regulations and less crime to begin with. Of course they dont need to be better armed. Crime in the US doesn't correlate. We dont have issues with tape, murder, sexual assault, theft, burglary, home invasions etc because of the cops. Disarming the cops will not make these things get better. \n\nWe would need radical economic and educational improvements in the country to make a difference. Yet, we aren't pushing for defunding and rebuilding our education system, just the cops who have to deal with the fallout of a failing system that breeds crime.\n\nAnd have you ever tried using social services in our country? I have. Its absolutely terrible. I had to call in a child abuse case. I talked with a school counselor and an officer who both told me, even though they shouldn't, that there had been many previous complaints. The division of family services pulled the kids, confirmed the report, and did 1 in home interview and then did 0 follow up and dropped it. A few months later, the parents were drunk and fighting a couple of hours before school started. It devolved into a physical altercation. The cops arrested one of them for domestic assault.

I was convicted of a felony DUI I had a passenger who luckily only had very minor injuries but it made it a felony and then violated my probation for weed.So instead of sending me to do the 3 years in general population prison. They have what's called a 120 treatment program. It is actually still in the state prisons and it take a few months of sitting in county jail, then being in 13 hour lock down for about a month and the prison but after that you get transfered to a different unit that makes you do roughly 6 to 8 hours of groups, and classes  Monday through Friday, and if you don't have a diploma they provide all of the materials and have teachers from the local college come and help you practice 4 times a week till you pass. And your still technically in prison, and besides the classes it is just the same as general population in what you have basically commissary junk foods 1 tv and books, but it is a much safer environment as any violence, or drug use, or any contraband your automatically kicked out and sent to do your backup. From what I hear there's quite a few states that have these and even in missouri I know they need way more as alot of people sentenced to a 120 treatment end up just sitting in the 23 hour max security lock down for the whole time since there aren't enough beds but still very cool they have it. Also missouri and almost every state at this point have something in place that if it's your first felony and it's not violent or sexual if you complete your probation, sentence , or parole they remove it from the record so it's essentially gone. On the war on drugs I think we are headed to it being fought more by ya know helping the addicts then fighting the suppliers as it should be thanks for commenting man and definitely keep putting the word out there we need more programs like I was lucky enough to go through because it isn't gonna be anlugh until there is a bed for any addict who winds up in the system and need treatment not a punishment",

I'm talking about anytime there's been someone who makes a government salary that I contributed to with my tax dollars who also became convicted of some type of child abuse.\n\nAnyway, this decision seems like it's about providing public transportation to church events when they have one in a city. I think it would be a net positive for the city to do this. More transportation would make it more likely the church group comes back to a city and the city makes money from repeat events and also from the increased need for transportation.",

They're almost exclusively looking for firearms left in vehicles overnight with the goal of using these firearms in crimes in Midtown and East of Troost. \n\nOf course, the next time the pistol is seen (if ever) is at a shooting in a minority-inhabited part midtown, of which there are a lot. There's no state licensing regime to tell the people in the Northland that they need to keep their firearms under supervision at all times, nor any real punishment for leaving your gun in your truck unattended. The reaction to this is, of course, a collective shrug, because the attitude of most white urban and suburban voters in Missouri is \"why's it my problem if they kill each other down there?\"\n\nThere are other problems that also contribute to the violence, like generations of police brutality and (up until recently) a lack of real witness protection, but the proliferation of firearms makes finding one for a crime easy if you're already willing to steal one.",

They win both ways with that argument, because they can sell more guns to scared people and more guns to police forces.\n\nAgain, I've given KC a decade and it's only gotten worse.

I know it\u2019s easy to think that there is when it\u2019s someone else\u2019s problem, I used to think that way too until I got sick. I can provide them with a doctors note, but at the end of the day, if someone doesn\u2019t care enough to make it happen for me, there\u2019s nothing I can do to make them. If the campus Covid coordinator, the professor, and the SDRC all say they don\u2019t care, there\u2019s nothing more I can do. You think my doctors are going to come down to campus and talk to someone for me like they\u2019re my mom discussing a gluten-free diet with my kindergarten teacher?

But I moved to Humboldt to be here. So now I have to apply to different universities (which costs money), postpone graduation for a YEAR (which puts off grad school for another year and a half), and I\u2019d have to move away because I wouldn\u2019t have any financial aid to live on. \n\nDo you see how ridiculous that is? All because of one single school to which I have already applied, been accepted, moved to Humboldt for, and have attended for two years doesn\u2019t want to help me. To you, it\u2019s a theoretical hurdle. To me, it\u2019s as arbitrary as if they refused you because of the color of your hair. If HSU refuses you right now, if they didn\u2019t even have the decency to call and you just showed up to class and the teacher pretended like you didn\u2019t exist, how far would that derail you? How much of your life would that cost you, if people let it be someone else\u2019s problem?",

One of my friends roommates has had a symptomatic positive test for 5 days now and still has not gotten any useful communication from anyone on campus. That whole roommate group has been isolating in their room together, further exposing the two people who are not sick because the school hasn\u2019t deigned to even communicate with the symptomatic roommate, let alone isolate them. The conditions in isolation sound horrible and I can\u2019t begin to grasp how a school that houses this many people on campus in tightly packed dorms thought that 56 beds would ever be enough given the sheer amount of data that had come out before we came back showing just how infectious omicron is. Omicron is officially as measles, which was previously the most infectious disease we had ever seen. The transmissibility rate is crazy and they took that information and somehow concluded that dorms would be a safe environment. \nIn regards to the CDC isolation guidelines, unfortunately they blatantly go against research. The CDC released the new isolation guidelines, but did not cite the research they were following. Infectious period has been proven to last somewhere between 3 and 9 days, and another study described the infectious period as \u201cabout 2 days before the onset of symptoms until about 4-5 days after symptoms. However, just because the majority of vaccinated cases are no longer infectious after five days, those that are and unvaccinated cases still should have been included into the isolation timeline set out by the CDC. All of the studies available however are from before the Omicron variant came into play, meaning we should be functioning with more caution, certainly not less.  The link for the article that i pulled this information from is here: [isolation guidance source](https://yourlocalepidemiologist.substack.com/p/state-of-affairs-dec-28)",

The student community is just starting to get boosted and even if 100% got boosted this week, it would be two more weeks before max efficacy was reached.    Hence the explosion in cases now.  In the meantime, the city of SLO is woefully unboosted and is at a real risk.  Finally, the virus can spread via asymptomatic people.  For fuck sake... we are two years into this pandemic.

And the school Dashboard vax rate (which is your reference for \"we're all vaccinated.\") reflects ONLY the two doses... NOT boosted vaccination rate.  Hence, this current record-breaking spike reflects an UNboosted student community.  And this further puts the surrounding community at risk.\n\nSo yes, I am well aware that Omicron is more mild.  I have read the medical journals showing animal studies indicating Omicron replication in the lungs is significantly smaller than Delta, Alpha and the original contagion.  However, Delta is still being transmitted and remains the dominant variant in SLO county.  \n\nBut since you want to be obtuse about things,  \"yes\" Omicron-related hospitalization rates as a percentage of cases is lower than other variants.  But the raw number of hospitalization rates is becoming very concerning.  Nationwide, it is eye popping in some locations.  Locally, it is becoming concerning.  French Hospital is past 90% ICU capacity as of today.  County-wide, we are approaching Delta and Alpha numbers.  So while you may then say \"well, what the lack of deaths, smarty pants?\"  Well, hopefully not.  Time will tell if that raw number rivals other waves.   But what no one seems to be taking about is \"long\" C19.  We have no idea of the hundreds of students who have had it nor the hundreds more who will get it because of the administration's incompetence, if they will develop respiratory or heart conditions shortly after recovery or years later.  That is the onion that infectious disease experts are now trying to unravel.  And I have personal family experience of members getting C19 and then having Angioplasty as well as a coronary artery stent put in nearly a year after fully recovering.\n\nSo since you apparently prefer the the Armstrong pollyanna approach to this pandemic, maybe we can just cut to the chase:  What is your magic number before you become concerned and actually care?  How many people need to go the hospital or die before you stop tracking a percentage that every infectious disease expert has expressed is meaningless and now we need to track raw hospitalizations numbers more closely.

I would be more concerned if Cal Poly tried to cover up for him, or continued to let him remain in a position of power, with an influence over the well-being of others.  That being said, I'm surprised he is only suspended for 4 years.  In my opinion (which I am aware means nothing), he should be outright expelled, and not permitted to continue his degree.  He plowed over two people, left them suffering without help, and lied about it.  I think we all saw the video-it was cold and heartless.

And then heroin was replaced by fentanyl which made it 10x worse than it already was. \n\nIn the 90s and 2000s there were millions of Americans using pharma opiates recreationally but relatively few of them died because of the consistency of the narcotics in the pills. Then in the late 2000s when the pills dried up everyone switches to heroin, which is more powerful and varies in potency. Then during the 2010s heroin was completely eliminated and replaced with fentanyl, which is even stronger than heroin and varies extremely in potency based on the type of fentanyl derivative and how it was mixed. There are dozens of types of fentanyl that have been found on American streets (remifentanyl carfentanyl  paraflourofentanyl etc etc).. Lots of people don\u2019t know it yet, but real organic poppy heroin is completely gone in Indiana. It doesn\u2019t exist anymore.. If someone talks about using heroin in 2023, it\u2019s actually just fentanyl. They can make it look similar, but it\u2019s not diamorphine anymore it\u2019s just fentanyl derivatives, which again vary wildly in potency which causes the extreme amount of overdoses versus pharma opiates. \n\nThe solution is to give people access to regulated pahrma grade narcotics, but people aren\u2019t ready to hear about that yet. In another couple decades when enough old people die off we will eventually implement such things. Canada has been testing out programs like that because they work, but of course a lot of ignorant people will bitch about allowing people to buy drugs legally.\n\nAlso, drugs like methadone and buperenorphine (suboxone) are extremely extremely important and the best tool we have currently to fight the problem. Those medicines should be given out like candy to people with opiate problems. They are extremely safe and even if they are abused. People are always like \u201coh you can\u2019t just give them to everyone because they\u2019ll abuse them and sell them\u201d\u2026 But the bottom line is the more users doing subs and methadone, the less people doing fentanyl and dying.

Workforce is struggling, but I expect there will be a balance and the reality is that with automation workforce is less of a concern than 10 years ago and will be less of a concern 10 years from now.",

Some of the best children\u2019s doctors work there. Unfortunately what I\u2019ve seen in healthcare (I work in sales for a biologics/rare disease treatment company) in this state is the arms race of new facilities, using funding and money to build these Taj Mahals of hospitals\u2026.at the expense of good physicians and nursing staff. I saw firsthand the contrast when I went with my brother-in-law to his daughters doctor appointment out near Boston. Small, simple hospital straight out of the 1970s, nothing super fancy\u2026great care and service. And at the time they were on state government assistance (getting a small business of the ground) and it covered their whole visit. I was amazed at how much better it was out there. My brother-in-law had to be rushed to the ER one time, and they paid almost nothing. But remember Massachusetts is the state that Obama care was basically modeled after. I\u2019m typically a moderate centrist who leans right, and even I think our healthcare system is fucked up\u2026. My son was in the NICU after some birth complications and we owed $20,000 afterwards. With employee insurance!! I know that one of the factors bringing our quality of care score down is the high cost of care in Indiana. I think it\u2019s Parkview Hospital in Fort Wayne has the highest billing prices in the nation. The whole system is ridiculous and goes to pay for these super fancy facilities, so that the networks can recruit more patients. This isn\u2019t college football, it\u2019s healthcare. That\u2019s been my biggest problem with Indiana. The same families on Medicaid pay nearly nothing for NICU care, while I get stuck with a $20,000 bill. The middle class gets hosed because we aren\u2019t rich enough to just say \u201coh no big deal\u201d, but we aren\u2019t economically disadvantaged enough to warrant government coverage. That has to change no matter what state you are in.\n\nBut I\u2019ll say this\u2026it\u2019s a LOT better than in the south. My grandfather died as a result of them not taking care of something relatively cut and dried. They lived in Chattanooga and it was a total clusterfuck down there. He had a cracked sternum from a fall, and instead of wiring it together they just let it go, and he withered away over a year. By the time my dad (500 miles away and not aware of how truly bad it had gotten) finally went down and forced the doctors to do something it was too late, and my grandfather passed in his sleep in March. That wouldn\u2019t have happened here I\u2019d like to think. I mean it was lawsuit worthy how badly they fucked up, and didn\u2019t know what the hell they were doing. Unless you live in Nashville, Atlanta or another major city with a research hospital, healthcare in the south is pretty damn bad",

        "body": "This seems like an incredibly shallow reading of both critical race theory and Marxism. Setting aside that CRT is a diverse field within broader critical theory that is itself comprised of a vast array of subgenres dealing with a variety of different social experiences, something that seems to undermine this claim that CRT is pitting \"one group (who can only do good) against another group (who can only do evil)\", who *exactly* is making these claims?\n\nBecause, I've read a fair bit of this literature, and I struggle to think of anyone who claims that. Like Marxism, it has nothing to do with the attitudes or beliefs of any individual, it's about the power of structures to create and enforce divisions within society. Hell, \"good\" and \"evil\" aren't really terms that critical theorists have found useful or had any interest in since Nietzsche. Frankly, this characterization seems like an attempt by the legislature to take concepts out of context in order to avoid confronting potentially uncomfortable ideas (something that the legislature would usually tell you is the entire point of higher education).\n\nTake, for instance, this \"CRT training\" narrative. While sure, inclusivity training is often *informed* by critical theory (and I'm not interested in arguing this training's merits, because a) you've clearly already made up your mind, and b) this is a separate issue within the broader phenomenon of conservative grievance politics that really has no bearing on academic theory), they're not at all the same thing. To quote the American Bar Association:\n\n>CRT is not a diversity and inclusion \u201ctraining\u201d but a practice of integrating race and racism in society that emerged in the legal academy and spread to other fields of scholarship. Crenshaw\u2014who coined the term \u201cCRT\u201d\u2014notes that CRT is not a noun, but a verb. It cannot be confined to a static and narrow definition but is considered to be an evolving and malleable practice. It critiques how the social construction of race and institutionalized racism perpetuate a racial caste system that relegates people of color to the bottom tiers. CRT also recognizes that race intersects with other identities, including sexuality, gender identity, and others. CRT recognizes that racism is not a bygone relic of the past. Instead, it acknowledges that the legacy of slavery, segregation, and the imposition of second-class citizenship on Black Americans and other people of color continue to permeate the social fabric of this nation.\n\nThis is literally just recycled Trump policy, right down to the vague language attempting to ban reductionist strawmen.\n\nAnd yes, making children feel guilty for things they didn't do is bad. *Exactly* which CRT authors are claiming otherwise? I assure you, marginalized groups do not want guilt, and they're not asking for it. What good is it to them? But more importantly, why does this justify this particular legislation, particularly at the University level? For every child who was traumatized by concepts of racial equity they weren't ready to properly grasp (a number that I suspect is in the single digits nationally) I can point you to probably hundreds of generic white dudes who graduated from business school believing that anyone who was poor had to deserve to be poor, black people are disproportionately likely to be imprisoned because they're simply more prone to crime, that the forced removal of native peoples was justified because they weren't using the land properly, etc, precisely because they were never required to critically reflect on their worldview or consider the perspectives of others, and who would have likely benefited from actually studying CRT in an academic setting.",

While there are certainly processes by which parents can express grievances about curricula (processes that would already cover most of the objectionable strawmen this bill is legislating against, rendering this legislation moot), there is no direct link between taxpayers and the curricula being taught in their local schools, *nor should there be*. For one, most residents of many districts don't even have school age kids, and thus aren't really stakeholders in a school's educational experience, and many districts are dominated by people who would want schools to teach objectionable or false things.\n\nBut more importantly, I have to ask again: where are these super expensive critical theory programs happening? How much are they costing the taxpayer? Seems to me like this is just more of the legislature's bullshit culture war nonsense aimed at getting people upset over a non-issue.",

That white people have in the past and still currently whether actively or in actively support and purpetuate a system of racism against racial minorities. It creates two heterogenous group divisions. \n\nIn the same way Marxism creates two group divisions in the class struggle between the bourgeoisie (which is vaguely defined) and the proletariat (also vaguely defined). \n\n>\tBecause, I\u2019ve read a fair bit of this literature, and I struggle to think of anyone who claims that. Like Marxism, it has nothing to do with the attitudes or beliefs of any individual, it\u2019s about the power of structures to create and enforce divisions within society.\n\nThe actions, attitudes, and beliefs make up the society. But CRT removes that and puts in its place some ethereal white supremacy that people (specifically white people) perpetuate whether they intend to or not. This then removes people\u2019s attitudes, beliefs, and actions from the equation as people are then guilty of perpetuating it whether they want to or not. \n\n>\ta) you\u2019ve clearly already made up your mind, \n\nI made up my mind by reading studies on its efficacy and found that it at best did little and only in the short term, and at worst backfired. The people it worked best with were the people that wanted to be there and basically nobody *wants* to be at a corporate, or school \u201ctraining\u201d seminar. Especially if a majority of the seminars blame you for the problems because of your skin color. \n\nI recently had to take a diversity training and I could tell it was informed by CRT as it acted as though racism by other ethnicities didn\u2019t exist, the antagonist in every scenario was white. \n\n>\tAnd yes, making children feel guilty for things they didn\u2019t do is bad.

You know what the majority of the studies I looked at said was the most effective at reducing ALL prejudice? Simple exposure, no sociological narrative, no forced seminars, no required courses, simply being around people. \n\nIt\u2019s the most simple and logical answer too. I can feel targeted or bored and get nothing out of a seminar or class, or discount it completely due to its Marxist roots, I\u2019m just there to check a box. But it\u2019s really hard to keep stereotypes and preconceived notions alive while interacting with those people they are about.",

        "body": "Okay\n\n>It\u2019s the fundamental premise of CRT\n\nIt's really not, though. Again, setting aside that it's a diverse field that you're painting with a single wide brush, I don't know of a single author who would claim that a racist social order is inevitable, or that individuals bear responsibility for actions that they didn't commit, or that racism is an immutable aspect of anyone's character. In the same way, this:\n\n>Marxism creates two group divisions in the class struggle between the bourgeoisie (which is vaguely defined) and the proletariat (also vaguely defined\n\nIs false. For one thing, the \"bourgeoisie\" (those who control the means of production) and \"proletariat\" (those whose labor produces value for those who control the means of production) aren't really that vaguely defined. Say what you will about Marx, but one thing that's certain is he was an economist's economist. He's not overly concerned about the actions or attitudes of any individual member of any particular class (i.e. greed), he was focused on the systemic, structural antagonisms created by those who labor and those who control the flow of labor's value. Similarly, CRT authors are less concerned about people perpetuating racist systems by doing racist things, and more concerned about the dynamics at play between racial identities and legal/social structures that bind members of society. Because it turns out society and racism are both more than the \"actions, attitudes, and beliefs\" of individuals.\n\nSpeaking of, I'm not entirely sure what you're talking about being replaced by whiteness. Do you mean that CRT only understands the social order through the lens of race? Because that's patently false. The author who coined the term CRT even goes out of her way to explicitly define it as intersectional. Which again leads me to believe that you're actually not at all familiar with the literature itself so much as a conservative caricature of it.\n\nFor instance, a CRT analysis of the 13th amendment banning forced labor \"except as a punishment for crime\" provides valuable insight into Jim Crow laws, racial vigilantism, and the roots of the modern penal system. It does so by acknowledging both the racial dynamics at play in the way society was restructured post-emancipation, as well as the economic forces contributing such a project, thus providing new perspective and greater dimension to the history students should already know. This bill would prevent a discussion of this cogent historical analysis at *the University level*, not because it's false or damaging to students, but because it's viewed as threatening to the dominant social order.\n\nAlso, regarding this:\n\n>I recently had to take a diversity training and I could tell it was informed by CRT as it acted as though racism by other ethnicities didn\u2019t exist, the antagonist in every scenario was white.\n\nSo? I'm literally a white dude, and I could not care less. Is that what this is all about? You're upset you had to go to training you didn't like? Because it kind of sounds like you're proving my point about not wanting to confront the potential that there could be lingering structural racism in a predominantly white society.\n\nAnd as for these traumatized children (of which I don't think there's been a single one in the state of Oklahoma), you haven't answered the core question: even if we accept that children shouldn't be exposed to certain complicated ideas, why would this justify censoring ideas *at all levels of education* via legislation? Why is that not a situation that can be handled through normal procedures for expressing grievances? And if you're so concerned about the discomfort of these white students, what about the marginalized students who are frequently fed damaging messages about their identity in the course of their education, not to mention their daily existence? Is it not valuable to consider questions of race to make the educational experience more welcoming and responsive for students who are disproportionately at risk? It seems like you want authors you haven't read to bear responsibility for things they didn't do based on ideas that someone else didn't understand, which honestly is a precedent that would hurt CRT authors far less than the people up in arms about them. I mean, are we gonna ban talking about capitalism because poor students suffer social stigmas?\n\nAnd finally, if you're gonna accuse someone else of strawmanning, maybe don't assert that they made assumptions they didn't make?\n\nFor instance, where did I talk about a two hour seminar? If you'll look at the paragraph you quoted again, you'll see that I said these kids \"would have likely benefited from actually studying CRT in an academic setting\", i.e. engaging with the actual scholarship in the classroom instead of repeating misrepresentations in an attempt to discount entire academic fields that make them ask uncomfortable questions.\n\nBut just for shits and giggles let's go ahead and look at the claims about efficacy, because I actually don't believe you've read any studies on the issue. I believe you read an article, maybe even just a headline, and took the findings as presented at face value because they confirmed something you wanted to be true. I believe this because 2 minutes of Googling brought up a [review of 178 scholarly articles on the topic](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C44&q=diversity+training&oq=diversity+tr#d=gs_qabs&u=%23p%3DdzOZ-BnkZrAJ) which found that diversity training programs are not a monolith, and not only are many programs impactful, but many could be even more impactful if they were deployed more effectively, as well as a [study of cultural sensitivity training in med schools](https://sigmapubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1547-5069.2004.04029.x) that found such training leads to improved doctor/patient relationships and better patient outcomes.\n\nSo, yes, fundamentally incurious people who have determined beforehand that they're not going to listen to the sensitivity training because they discount entire schools of thought because of tangentially-related boogeymen might not change their behavior. Oh well, they can stick their head in the sand and stay in the past until the present inevitably catches up to them. That doesn't mean that others won't gain something from it, and that certainly doesn't justify legislating against it, especially when it seems like you're arguing that exposure to and understanding of other people's narratives (the explicit goal of cultural competency training, whether effective of not) challenges stereotypes.",

Education makes up more than half of that at 3.6 billion.  We are already spending enough money, we are already taxing our citizens enough.  This doesn't make me a heartless bastard who doesn't think our teachers need to be paid more or that education doesn't need more funding.  Our teachers do need more money.  We need to do some serious introspection and look at how 3.6 billion dollars is being spent. There has to be enormous amounts of waste. Taxing our citizens isn't the way.  It's a trap and we've fallen for it before. Remember the lottery?\n\nWe need better teacher representation in the state legislature, and this is starting to happen.  We need legislators who better understand the problems our districts are facing.  Every district should undergo an audit to see just how each dollar is being spent.  There is way too much waste and poor prioritization.  Students are not being put first.\n\nWe need to look at other states and figure out how they are doing so well and how we are doing so poorly.  The answer isn't more money, education is getting plenty of it.  Throwing more money at it won't solve the problem.  I think after some investigating we will find the problem is how money is being spent. \n\nHaving said all that, this will probably pass and everyone will look like fools when more than half of it doesn't go to education and the people who live in poverty in this state have a harder time affording basic necessities they already can't afford.  This is terrible public policy.\n\nI cannot in good conscience vote yes for this state question and I encourage others to seek alternatives.

I feel like there is a chance that administration is getting more of the pie than the teachers themselves.  I also feel like there is too much administration at higher levels.  I too am the husband of a teacher for a public school, and the cuts have been insane.  Any fundraiser done by any of the clubs have to give 10% of their proceeds to the school.  No printer or copier use.  Students are charged lab fees that never seems to go towards purchasing lab equipment.    They are using e-texts now that are being caught daily with poor information, bad editing and writing, and sometimes completely unusable lessons.  When she was teaching anatomy, she even had to buy her own specimens.  Art classes are being cut to the bone.  Outside organizations and clubs are dying unless they get sponsorship or are willing to do everything on the backs of the parents.\n\nInterestingly enough, the football team seems to always have enough money for uniforms, equipment, and for the coaches to get paid an extra hour of pay, even though their football practice actually takes place during regular school hours.\n\nThat $5000 a year would be really nice in our pocket, and I am voting for that.  But in 8 years when we are in the same place, there still won't be a solution.  Until the union (that is funded by the teachers, btw) decide to organize a statewide strike and get some people's attention, I don't see it ever changing. ",

I was lucky to hear him speak in the 80s!  Wonderful orator.\n\nI mentioned having an advanced degree because it was relevant to the point, not to win an argument.  I want to come to understand the truth but everytime I ask you for some answer to a question you volley with attacks on my intelligence and schooling, you fail to respond to my simple questions, and then clutch your pearls at me when I try to explain that I\u2019m not just some amateur here.  I\u2019ve spent a long time debating vaccine safety - before COVID - and so I want to honestly be proven wrong if I am wrong.  I love being wrong cause it opens my mind further.  It\u2019s why I focused on Philosophy.  \n\nI don\u2019t feel your goals here are as genuine as mine because you keep throwing fallacies around like fireworks to distract me (doesn\u2019t work, I\u2019ve been doing this for 3 decades now).  Just please, if you want your points to be taken seriously, stop the childish peacocking and just discuss the facts.  \n\nYes the vaccine isn\u2019t 100% safe.  No vaccine is, based on how it functions.  However it\u2019s the safest option we\u2019ve ever found and until we can find better, we have to go for what works for the most.  Seat belts don\u2019t stop all injuries but we know they decrease them.  And since injuries from vaccines are orders of magnitude lower than injury and death from COVID, and vaccines reduce viral loads, it\u2019s dangerous NOT to be vaccinated and you risk hurting others.\n\nMaybe if antivaxxers were the proponents that said \u201cstay home and quarantine and we don\u2019t need vaccines\u201d I\u2019d be more sympathetic.  But you folks are causing the spread and the long delays in getting life back to some sort of normal.  I\u2019ve been vaccinated since day 1 and have stayed home running my business for 18 months now.  I\u2019m doing my part and it angers me that you folks show zero social responsibility.  And that\u2019s why I will stand here and take your abuse and insults and continue to speak truth.  I know it\u2019s a risk but it\u2019s your moral duty to take it.  Period.

In school the locals and the imports were very seperate and imports were excluded from a lot of stuff simply because our dads and moms, and grandads and grandmoms and greatgrandads and greatgrandmoms hadn't been friends in school for generation after generation. Another thing to note, now that I'm 20 years out of that town and only go back to visit friends. Those that never left town and stayed while all the imports went off to other towns and college, there is a very strange sense of shame they carry. It's pretty saddening. Being someone that never made it out, they suffer for it. Not that those of us that come back put them down or anything, it's kind of self inflicted. Also, I did have a friend come back and try to start a business, he was blocked at every turn. It was baffling.
