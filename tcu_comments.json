I like to think that the Economics degree, with its emphasis in theory, taught me how to think and adapt to various fields of business. I graduated in 2015 and have since worked jobs in Supply Chain, Human Resources, and Business Operations with specific roles stretching from data analyst to program manager.\n\nTo reiterate, I don't think Econ limits your opportunities as compared to Neeley.

You have to take classes for all disciplines but you\u2019re not gonna sink 4 years into accounting only to realize you want to be in marketing and wasted your time. No in the ways another person mentioned. Econ is all theoretical and pretty much completely useless for any entry level job (unless you go into research). You won\u2019t get the same technical skills the business school offers (if it\u2019s still not part of Neely) and for your first couple jobs it\u2019s significantly harder to get an entry level job in, say, finance without a finance major. I worked for a F500 in entry level finance and only got that after I got my MBA. I found out that when we post entry level jobs, we get hundreds of applications if not more. Without a finance major or graduate degree your resume pretty much gets insta-trashed. So it\u2019s way harder to get your foot in. \n\nThat being said, once you get in you do have a more broad understanding of market reactions and consequences. If you want to be a CFO you have to spend a few years (typically) in accounting, finance, M&A and operations. They want you well rounded and Econ is potentially a good path for that.\n\nIf you pair it with a good minor or even a double minor you\u2019ll be perfectly fine. Also (this may have changed) but it is easier. If you know you want to go to grad school having a few points higher GPA can\u2019t exactly hurt.",

Shocker. Never heard that one before.\n\nFirst of all, get off the dating apps. You're in freakin' college, all the girls are right around you, why are you on dating apps? Those things are toxic anyway, for both men and women. \n\nTo meet women 2 things need to happen. 1, you need to be around women in an environment where women are interested in meeting men in a romantic sense. And 2, you actually need to understand women and be good at interacting with them.\n\nJoining a frat might help with Issue #1. But it's in no way going to help you with issue #2. If you're at a bunch of frat parties, but you don't know how to talk to women, it's not really gonna help all that much.\n\nI don't know who you are or what you're like, but in general here are a few pieces of advice.\n\n1. Don't be a creep. Don't approach women from behind, and don't stand around awkwardly being quiet. When you approach women you should always approach them from the front so they can see you coming. And when you introduce yourself to women you should start talking to them like it's no big deal, like it's something you do all the time.\n2. Don't be a Nice Guy. Don't expect that just because you are Nice to women, that they should have sex with you. This is the opposite extreme of the Douchebag, but it's equally as gross. Women are people. Treat them like people. That means they deserve your respect, but they don't owe you anything in return for it.\n3. DO be passionate about interesting things. Read books. Go to concerts. Take dance lessons. Don't waste your life playing video games and watching YouTube videos. Make yourself more interesting. In general women like art, and dancing, and singing, and talking about good books and relationships. Find something that women like that you're also passionate about. Watch Pride and Prejudice. Understand why women all laugh at Mr. Collins. Don't be Mr. Collins.\n4. DO be funny and confident. Learn how to tell jokes. You know Dad Jokes? Men don't immediately start making jokes when they become dads. It's the opposite, men who are funny get to become dads. If you don't think you're funny, start watching comedians and start thinking about how they say things and what they talk about. Some good ones to watch are John Mulaney Matthew Brousard, and Taylor Tomlinson (Taylor Tomlinson is awesome). On a day to day basis check out John Oliver and Stephen Colbert. \n\nAnd remember, there are 4 things you should never talk about if you're trying to flirt with women, or if you're on a first date: Religion, Abortion, Politics, and Exes. There's an acronym there. Remember to never talk about those 4 things.",

She was fantastic and we had a nice relationship. \n\nRegarding fraternities:\n\nJoining a fraternity could be one of the best things you ever do.  6 of my fraternity brothers and I still communicate daily and have for 30 years. I\u2019m not kidding.  You can truly make the friends who will stand in your wedding and carry your casket. Fraternities are not automatic \u201cget girls\u201d machines. \n\nThe best thing fraternities provide from the \u201cgetting a  girl\u201d perspective is a regular series of fun events to invite girls to.  I never really met any girl I dated AT a fraternity party, rather I invited a girl I was interested in TO a fraternity party. Sometimes her friends were going with my friends and it made it a low pressure situation for both of us.  I still had to try and be confident, funny, and charming. \n\nIf you don\u2019t join a fraternity, you can still invite girls to cool events.   Group events have less pressure.  Go to a basketball or baseball game. Ask them to a concert.  Take them to a tailgate before a football game.  Do these things before you ask them on a more romantic or one on one date.  Those can be high pressure and may make a girl  hesitant.  \n\nTCU is the best school in the world to meet awesome women.  I\u2019m still friends with several women I dated at TCU and they are remarkable people.  You\u2019ve at a great place.  Good luck. \n\nJust my 2 cents.",

There tons of groups, organizations, activities ***to be social*** without the requirements of a frat.\n\nThe group of friends I graduated with (12+), and still keep in touch with 20 years later, only 2 were in a sorority (1 dropped out because some of their rules were oppressive).

But there is so much more to college and life than those things as well. \n\nI know freshmen year can be hard - my first year in college, I felt so alone, was struggling in classes and with relationships, etc. But as some other people already said, focus on making friends. I didn't go on a single date until the last semester of my senior year of college, but I did have amazing friends that cared about me (and I cared about them). And since you're still new to TCU, maybe just focus more on finding your community than a significant other. Being in a relationship is great, but it's also a lot of work. \n\nFinally, be cautious of people who say that \"meeting women\" is an easy 2-step process. It's not. Women are humans and humans are complex. You are human and you are complex. Don't think you can just plug yourself into a situation, say the right lines and someone will automatically fall in love with you. When I met the woman who I would eventually marry, we were friends for 3 years before we went on our first date. Sometimes these things take time. \n\nI encourage you to not put so much pressure on yourself. You deserve to be loved, and that love can come from community, friends, and family just as much as a significant other.",

Bars and clubs are where a lot of people go to find easy partners, but those places come with disadvantages. If you spend time doing things you like and that are actually fun, you\u2019re a lot more likely to find someone you can have an actual relationship with.\n\nYou\u2019re in college, so pretty much any party you go to will have flirty overtones with a lot of the people in attendance. Just learn to tell the difference between people who like you as a friend, and people who are romantically interested in you. Both are good things to have and cultivate. Just don\u2019t get upset if a girl says she wants to be friends with you and isn\u2019t interested in dating, most girls you meet are just gonna want to be friends, and that\u2019s okay. \n\nAlso, don\u2019t focus just on girls.

Briles and AD Ian McCaw sent texts that shamed and blamed victims;and indicated they would work with the Waco PD to cover up the crimes. They also actively recruited players with a history of abuse against women.\n\nThe degree to which other members of the staff participated in the cover ups is debatable. But it\u2019s hard to believe Art Briles and McCaw were the only bad actors.\n\nKendall Briles was also a coach at Baylor during this time. In the past he\u2019s publicly defended his father, and implied that the accusations against him are lies told by the media.\n\nWe have a few text messages of Kendall\u2019s that don\u2019t look good in the context of what we now know. The most infamous is probably this one, which he sent to a recruit:\n\n\\> \u201cDo you like white women? Because we have a lot of them at Baylor and they love football players.\u201d\n\nIn short, hiring him would be a very bad look for TCU. It would have serious real world consequences.\n\nOther people may know more, and be able to share.",

The bathrooms don\u2019t automatically flush - not a huge deal but weird to see in a $4bil facility. The bathrooms ran out of paper towels. The amount of water pooling in the stadium and going down the stairs was surprising. We stayed to the TCU fight song so it was pouring outside when leaving.

That really is the only way to determine if you can afford to go there.  Also keep in mind that most colleges increase the tuition 3-5% per year, but merit scholarships do not get a cost adjustment from year to year after they are awarded.  I got my MS from TCU, but had to take a student loan.  I love TCU, but there are other great private universities that have generous merit scholarships such as Trinity in San Antonio or Southwesten in Georgetown.  Be sure to explore all your options.",

Grants are the unsung hero for low-income students, I had nearly 25% of my tuition across the 4 years paid for in grants alone. The largest one, I can't remember the name, was a grant that was for $10,000 a year, but would become a loan if you didn't finish school within a certain timeframe. Really motivated me to finish on time and do well.\n\nYou can also see if you're eligible for things like AmeriCorps. I worked a job out of college advising high school students and got a bit of my tuition paid off.\n\nI'd recommend reaching out to the admissions office at your current school and TCU to see if they can help you find and apply for grants for which you meet the criteria.\n\nI still walked out of TCU with around $40k in debt, but, depending on your degree, that's something that can be easily paid off with some discipline.\n\nGood luck!",

Nursing comes to mind.  A lot of hospitals have deals where you give them how ever many years working at said hospital, they\u2019ll pick up the tab.  And TCU has an EXCELLENT Nursing Program.  (I had a surgery in 2020 and I had 2 nurses with thick NY accents, one from Brooklyn & the other from Long Island.   They were doing just that.  Working in Texas to get their college paid for. \n\nSame sort of deal with teaching.  I understand that if you commit to an underserved area after graduation for a specified number of years, they pay for tuition.  \n\nSame deal with ROTC.  \n\nJust a few things to check out.  \n\nI didn\u2019t understand If you were going in as a freshman or transferring in.   But some folks commented above and rightly so, DO NOT  go into crushing debt to go to TCU or any college or university.   There\u2019s a lot of options for you, pick up a phone and call financial aid  and ask questions to each university that you\u2019re considering.  Huge debt will make your life after college miserable!!   You\u2019ll regret it for years.  And I mean YEARS!!\n\nNow as a mom of a newly graduated son and an alumni of TCU.  I can offer to you that if you\u2019re a freshman going into whatever college, try to stay on campus.  It will make your college experience a lot different.  You\u2019ll connect to the university.  And make such great lifelong friends. And your college experience will be so much more enriched.  So there\u2019s my 2 cents worth.  Good luck to you and I wish you a wonderful and safe college experience.  \n\nPS. If you\u2019re going into engineering \u2014UTA is one of the FINEST engineering schools   in the country",

TCU is not only really popular right now because football is doing well, they're also trying to accept less people due to overcrowding on campus and an unprecedented soar in students accepting the acceptance offers last year.\n\nIf you do get accepted, be prepared to pay a lot of money. I graduated high school with a 4.2 GPA, #9 in my class of 520, extracurriculars and volunteer work, NHS officer, 1390 SAT, got accepted into TCU's honors college, and got $72,000 in scholarship. That may sound like a lot, but TCU costs over $300,000 for 4 years.

It\u2019s sort of in line with wanting diversity. I know it\u2019s gotten more competitive, probably slightly more so if you are from in state. I know the m/f ratios were like 35/65 when I was there so I think anything that makes people stand out, especially if from Texas, is a good thing. Being male probably worked and might still work in his favor. \n\nI\u2019m from another state, my high school didn\u2019t do rankings or even GPAs because it was small and private and catered to people with learning differences/ADHD. I applied with TCU\u2019s \u201cuncommon application\u201d for early action and I think I got mail right around the 15th.  I am sure so much has changed since I applied. I believe my gpa was calculated a little less than his and my SAT is a little higher, but they still had analogies in the SAT. The application I submitted had me submit my high school resume and a short essay I had written for an assignment in high school.\n\nSo I think he has good chances but I don\u2019t know how he fares compared to others in his demographics.",

The organizations have your contact info once you fill out the forms and can invite you to informal events.\n\nWhy not try for Spring too? You\u2019ll at least have your name in the system and get to meet some people. If you spread your net wide enough, you\u2019ll catch something, especially informally in the Fall. \n\nRegardless there\u2019s lots to do on campus if you get involved with clubs too. I play Ultimate Frisbee and it may not be Greek Life, but it is a pretty great community. You should apply if you haven\u2019t already!",

I know it\u2019s a pain, but if you look at the syllabus and realize that there a ton of work you weren\u2019t accounting for, it might be time to move - if the class you want to take is full, hop by the professor (and/or send an email) and chat with them about taking you on as an additional student. In many cases, they\u2019ll do it, particularly for professors you\u2019ve already had.\n\nGood luck this semester.",

After your first 2 years you will have a portfolio review that determines if you can continue in the program. Most students who made it that far passed without issue. Lots of people washed out during those first 2 years due to intensive studio classes. \n\nWhile a good education is useful in becoming a professional interior designer (particularly in learning the technical parts of the trade), I would say it is even more important to get as much practical experience as you can. Try to intern every summer, not just the last summer when it is required. Happy to answer any questions you have, even though my experience is a little out of date.

There are way too many options to scroll through in the drop down menu (when you click the upper left hand 3 lines).  Maybe make them subgroups like Academics (includes Library, myTCU, Classes, Computer Labs), Food (Dining, FrogBucks), Wellness/Leisure (Campus Rec, Athletics, Covid-19, Safety, KTCU) and Resources (News, Map, Ask SGA, TCU WiFi, Videos, Frogcalls, TCU Announce, Career Center).\n2. Once I choose an icon from the home screen, there's no automatic back button (to home), but instead I have to open the menu again and choose the home icon to essentially go back.  A continuous back button would be nice.\n3. My main gripe is that TCU's \"interactive map\" sucks.  And I understand that it's not from the app side but rather the website, but imho it's not intuitive at all, and the zoom feature on mobile is really hard to use.  I also dislike the labeling system of the map in general only showing Academic building names, but sometimes it shows no names at all.  I am confusion.  While I'm on the subject, what would really be useful would be a parking lot map, but that would require collaboration with TCU PD and TCU Safety because frankly the current PDF map can still be very unclear and is not easily decodable.  But perhaps some interactive parking map that might say something like \"Football game Saturday, you may only park in lots marked in orange\" (and have those lots orange on the map)\n\nThose are just my initial thoughts, but again maybe I'm not the right person to respond since I typically just navigate to my email or d2l or whatnot on a web browser on my laptop or phone.",

Take it for what it\u2019s worth:\n\nAs a successful first generation professional that had to learn how the job market and world works on my own, in my opinion this is much more of a long term career decision for you. \n\nWhile TCU has world class programs in both quantitative/stem fields and qualitative/artsy fields,  as a small university heavy on culture, social life and arts, it doesn\u2019t pack as hard of a punch in some of the stem fields like Comp sci. However, upon graduating and paying 3x the tuition you would elsewhere, the loyalty you might find among your friends and alumni network will be stronger than UTA or UTD. In other Texas cities I know the TCU guys to stick together even closer than the Aggies because there are fewer of them. \n\nNow does that matter to you? Maybe maybe not\u2026 and it\u2019s tough to ask yourself this as a developing 18-20 year old, but do you see yourself being a career analyst/technician type being fulfilled by honing your craft and working 40-50 hours a week and going home? Or do you see yourself being a leader or entrepreneur in that field? What you find among engineers and analysts in all fields is some do the actual work, and some, after a few years grow to manage the other engineers, projects and growing firms. The soft but ever so valuable skills to lead people will honestly be honed a little more naturally in a more social environment like TCU. But it\u2019s all what you make of it, no matter where you go. Texas A&M or UT are both good middle grounds.\n\nI would say if you are only going to do one degree go to a&m. If you want to set yourself up for success locally, think about undergrad at TCU then a masters at UTD. Good luck",

Also check how utilities are paid, which could add an extra cost per month if they are your responsibility to set up.\n\nAs far as furnished, unless you're cool with filth and poor management, avoid LoftVue.  Liberty Lofts are furnished but very much mostly students.  You might also have luck looking at Facebook Marketplace for students or community members with rooms for rent.

You also have to consider that USF is far larger than TCU, so if you want the big school experience, that should be a factor. \n\nIf cost were not a factor I would say TCU 100%. But I wouldn\u2019t go into debt to attend TCU.",

If I had to really give any advice it'd be to just be yourself and don't be afraid to take some time to think about your replies. Granted don't leave them waiting for forever, but if you need a second to process a question asked, that's perfectly fine. No one's rushing you to finish, and the interviewers are really just looking to get to know you in a way that online applications and forms can't. Take advantage of the fact that this is their first real impression of you and show them why you would be a great candidate.

The mentors are really great at answering any questions you have, helping you plan ahead, and just having someone to talk to. The workshops are usually amazing networking opportunities or generally just really useful for picking up new skills or familiarizing you with certain topics and industries.",

American football is a highly commercialized game at the higher levels, but college games retain more of a sense of community and \"Americana\" than NFL, particularly Cowboys games.  The Cowboys are literally the most valuable professional sports club in the world, more than the New York Yankees or even Barca and Real.  The stadium is a marvel, but it *feels* very plastic, even if the fan support is genuine.  Catch an NFL game if you can, but there's a good chance you won't prefer it to this game, even though the level of play is higher.\n\nBaylor/TCU is a mid-range rivalry or even a \"derby\" by American standards. For sheer scale, it's not Alabama versus Auburn or Texas versus Oklahoma, but passions run deep.   There are longstanding rumors that people associated with Baylor were responsible for the fire that damaged the TCU campus beyond use over a hundred years ago.  Both schools were in Waco then, but afterwards TCU moved to Fort Worth. I don't know if they're true, and it almost doesn't matter;  the mere fact that the rumors exist makes the point. \n\nThey were in the same conference for decades, but the rivalry (occasionally referred to as the \"revivalry\" in recent years due to quirks of American protestantism and both schools' origins as Christian schools) was interrupted for a time due to the utterly bizarre machinations that go into pretending that high level university sport in the US is an amateur endeavor, while simultaneously extracting as much money as possible out of it.  These days, the schools are on roughly even footing, athletically, and they're back to playing every year.\n\nNo doubt you heard that this was TCU's first game with a new head coach (\"manager\", really) in over 20 years.   The previous one had safely navigated TCU through the previously mentioned league/schedule drama and landed us back at a prominent level of competition (the analogy is not precise, but it's not entirely unlike being relegated three levels in a single go, then slowly building a program that could succeed as a mid-table club in the Premier league, with an occasional chance at Europe), but we had been struggling of late, and he was finding the new landscape of college football to be frustrating.  We were not expected to win, and doing so while clearly being the better team (on the day) was super cool.",

If you're religious there's a few programs you can join that have a ton of people and have fun activities. I'd caution you against StuMo tho. They want you to go be evangelicals on a Florida beach for 4 weeks and pay for the whole thing as well as work a job there and pay them more from that.\nI was in some of the engineering/stem clubs that were fun like SAE where you build a electric car.\n\nThe sports teams are pretty fun. I played rugby for awhile and that was an awesome group. I was also on the ranger challenge team and that was awesome.

It depends on the groups you are associated with. If you Greek Life, it will be less diverse than, say, a student organization. My dorm was pretty diverse my first year here, and I met a lot of different people!\n\n  \nAre they good at giving out money?

If you have decent test scores, you will get something.\n\n  \nFavorite thing about TCU and least favorite?  \nIt depends on the dorm you live in. Most of the First Year halls are on the older side, such as Foster and Waits, but are great halls to live in. I never had any roommate issues, but I knew people who did, and they seemed to get it resolved efficiently and quickly. As for my least favorite thing, It would have to be social life. Social life during my early years at TCU made it seem like you had to be in a Fraternity or Sorority to make friends and enjoy college life, but I have come to realize that it is what you make of it. \n\n  \nHow are dorms?  \nIt depends on the dorm you live in.

Off-campus, still pretty good but not as great as being on campus. There are always instances of crimes around the TCU area, as many other large cities do, and TCU PD has done a great job of helping keep things safe on campus for students!\n\n  \nDo they actually focus on Christian Faith a lot, or is it kind of swept under the rug?  \nI'm gonna use the exact quote someone else said. \"The C in TCU can be as big or as small as you want it to be.\" You only have to take one religion course, and it doesn't have to be over Christianity.",

Not my words, but just what I heard from many students who were previously in the department.\n\nTCU professors are very talented individuals and have real world experience to give back to their students. When I was told this information I was perplexed because it is the only department that I was aware had this issue.\n\nJust make sure while doing CS that you then use that deep understanding and apply it to actual projects throughout your years (HIGHLY RECOMMEND, especially if you want to get into software engineering). Trust me it will put you so far ahead. I had a previous relationship with one of the students in their junior year whom we hired to develop an app. He did not leave any comments, wrote bad code, and claimed his code was worth thousands(My cofounder and I were non-technicals back then and didn\u2019t know what Good Code was). Then when I had my friends mentioned earlier look at it, they said it was like worth $50 at most and we had to rebuild the whole app\u2026 fml. It did not leave a good impression on me.\n\nThough CS if applied right is a very hot market and definitely worth your time.\n\nThis was all back in 2020 when I found out this information.\n\nEdit: I\u2019m self-learning CS right now because it applies to the business job market.

Many internships favor students with some project experience, but you never really get significant project experience until your Senior Design Project or something you do freelance. I also believe the Intro to Programming course could be refined/reworked since many people don't make GUI using Java and start with something like Techniques in Programming, but that is my opinion.I also lived with some UTA CS majors, and their CS department is pretty intense. Their program is more coding-oriented, while TCU focuses on how computers work with code sort of idea.I intend on graduating next semester and believe my degree was worth it while also being pretty challenging.

I would maybe wait until towards the end of the interview to bring up financials, since then after hearing about the program a bit you can say something along the lines of \"This seems like a great program, I would be very happy to get in and make personal strides etc etc.  Could you tell me about opportunities to lessen the financial burden on myself and my family? It would be great to make this dream a reality, and finances are a part of that.\" And of course profusely thank them, and follow-up email the next day summarizing the interview, and a small bit about how financial assistance/grants/aid would be so helpful.

        "body": "First of all, NO to your title question.  Admissions are like any other school, of course for the elite few being wealthy and having connections can get one into a school but that is a minority of the tens of millions of US college students.  Typically financial situation is not considered in admissions, and aid packages come after acceptance, which then you as an individual need to consider (is the cost worth the benefits you see).  I honestly think the vast majority of people do not think of themselves as \"naturally gifted.\"  They might seem that way, but in many cases it is due to upbringing and hard work.\n\nWorking smart enough, and hard enough is usually enough to get into TCU; admissions for transfer students is substantially easier too since admissions is not trying to guess as much what the yield will be (they already know the class sizes of the current classes and how many transfers they can accept).\n\nI do not know who you know, but there is not one perfect person at TCU.  I am also wondering what you mean by IS (International Studies, Information Security, something else)?\n\nOverall, if you spend time crafting a nice application, you are likely to be accepted.  However, I would urge you to consider if you can afford it, as it might not end up as discounted as you hope.  Browse the scholarships and financial aid portions of the website, and call up financial aid as well, as they will try their best to answer questions.\n\nGood luck and Go Frogs!",

Like you said, some of the teachers are awful and don't like to teach, but that's not because it's a big school, it's because it's a bad program. I transferred to Texas State from UTA and didn't have any issues with teachers there, and the advisors were much more knowledgeable and helpful even though it's a similarly sized state school.\n\nTCU does give out a lot of financial aid, but tuition is high enough that it's still probably going to be expensive as a transfer student.\n\nI got by far the most financial aid offered at TCU, and it was still double what anywhere else I applied cost.",

        "body": "Hey there!\n\nI was in a similar position when I applied and eventually attended TCU. I managed to secure the Dean's scholarship (about half off of base tuition). I believe they review applications for Deans, merit, and chancellor scholarships upon application. I also got a small scholarship I used for books, etc. from the company where my parents both worked.\n\nMy advice would be to check out scholarship owl or other scholarship search engines. I was able to find a few smaller scholarships through them. Also, search for scholarships based on traits, like being a woman interested in business, first generation American, any Native American tribal memberships, first generation college student, etc. I'm Italian and was able to find some through Italian groups as well.\n\nI'm very glad I went to TCU, but something I wish I'd known was how little it ended up mattering that I went there. Given, I completed a nursing degree, so take with a grain of salt. I work with people that went and got degrees from other institutions for much cheaper than I spent, then were able to get our hospital to pay for further education. Same can be said for business and securing an MBA. There are so many MBA programs and really, once you're working, it'll be much easier to secure a job that can potentially pay some amount toward your degree and even offer a higher level position contingent upon your completion of the degree. I'm basing this off my sister in law who went to Baylor for both her business degree and MBA. While her MBA afforded her a new position within the company, was it worth the 6 figures of debt she accrued at Baylor when she could have gotten the MBA from anywhere? It makes a difference, of course, that she was paying for it versus her bachelors that her parents paid. \n\nANYWAY, I'm very glad I went to TCU despite having loans. Just some food for thought.",

I\u2019m also from CA, but I chose to move to Texas and attend Austin Community College online rather than a CCC. HOWEVER, I recommend staying at a CCC because of the time change, out of state tuition costs (yes, even for a CC), and convenience. My roommate for this coming semester attended Irvine Valley College and was accepted no problem. Neither of us had the greatest GPA/ACT scores, my GPA was a 3.5, 26 ACT. So fairly average and nothing special for an incoming freshman. During my first semester at ACC I did get a 4.0 and was accepted to TCU for strategic comm which was my first choice major. The transfer requirements are actually pretty easy, 2.75 minimum GPA during your time at community college. Technically ACT/SAT scores aren\u2019t required through 2023 but I do recommend taking it at least once just to get an idea of where you\u2019re at. When enrolling at a CC, be sure to check TCU transfer requirements and see what core courses you can take that will transfer credits over to TCU. If you put in the work to get a good GPA, admissions will see that you have improved academically. This is a great way to make up for your high school GPA (which isn\u2019t bad btw) and to prove that you have the ability to succeed at TCU. All in all, it is absolutely possible to transfer from a California community college. The transfer process is fairly simple, just ensure you will be taking classes that will meet some core requirements. Best of luck to you!!",

Now a practicing attorney in a large city. \n\nWhile polisci degrees are definitely not the most sought-after degree on the market, they do show employers your ability to read and write well, and analyze problems. Law school is traditionally the go-to move with a polisci degree because it will strengthen those skills even further. I have friends who graduated with polisci degrees who now work in consulting, sales, politics, and numerous other fields.\n\nWhat I know now that I wish I knew then is that ANY degree is valuable, you just have know how to leverage it. Networking and building relationships is by far the most important skill when acquiring a job. What do you want to do? Who do you look up to professionally? What attracts you to those individuals? These are questions that you should be able to answer before you make any decisions that may affect your future. Do not be afraid to cold email these people and ask what they did to get where they are. \n\nLastly, if I had to do it all over again, I would major in business and minor in something fun. You can go to law school with literally any background (if that's something you truly want to do), but the \"business world\" definitely prioritizes those with business experience over those that have none.",

A couple of my buddies got one (From a different school) and one ended up working at Best-buy before getting a job as an account manager at a trucking company, and the other got a job at a Tesla dealership delivering cars.\n\nIf you go that route I just recommend getting a grad degree. I got a different undergrad degree but still felt the need for a grad degree.\n\nI got a general social science degree with a focus in business + economics. I got a good job out of college from my dad, which I don't think I would have got anything similar without that help. And then I went on to get an MS degree in the field I wanted to be in. But graduated during the beginning of COVID which that field kind of dried up for the time being. Still got a job in that field but it was very low paying and not what I wanted to do in that field.\n\nBut now I'm in a better job slightly outside of that field.\n\nBasically, what I'm trying to say is: Poly-sci or similar degrees aren't terrible, but I wouldn't do that degree unless you are literally trying to get into politics, or if you can't get into the business school or whatever else school you're trying to get into. Unless you plan on getting a graduate degree, then it doesn't really matter all that much what your undergraduate degree is in.",

I would say if I was to simplify it, the split is probably about 60% left-leaning and 40% right-leaning, but there are people on all ends of the spectrum and most are relatively moderate. Overall, your political beliefs are only as important as you want them to be. Even during the height of this last election things were not too bad.\nGreek life, however, is unavoidable in my experience. If I remember correctly, over half of the student body is involved in Greek life. Assuming you are male, there are a few options with the fraternity experience that you can consider. There are the larger IFC frats (I think there are about 9) which are mostly the stereotypical frats with a lot of brothers. There are a few standouts which are more focused on academics or religion (which in my perception would be Beta Theta Pi and Beta Upsilon Chi respectively). From what it sounds like though, even these organizations might not be your kind of thing. TCU also has a ton of non-Greek student orgs for a variety of interests. Additionally, there are some smaller fraternities and some co-ed sororities that might be interesting for you. Me personally, I did the IFC Rush as a freshman but didn't find a place where I fit in. Later, I found a smaller music-based organization, with a little less than 20 memebers, where I found people who understood me a lot more. I'm now on their leadership team, and though I sometimes miss the idea of the \"typical TCU Greek experience\", I think I made the right choice.",

The Uni isn't going to write you a recommendation, the Prof you work under is, if you deserve it. Generally speaking getting into grad school is as much who you know as what you know. \n\nI did my BA at a small Liberal Arts School in nowhere IA. My advisor did his MS at TCU before going on to get his Ph.D. and then his first teaching job at the College I was at. I had an above average GPA, an above average GRE and a fantastic recommendation from someone that graduated from TCU's MS program I was applying to.\n\nThe point of the story? Look at the places the Biochem faculty at TCU came from. If you want to go there for grad school you have an in. That being said if your lab advisor is a prodigy and respected in the field they can give you recommendation to  some place they never went. Also, if you are some kind of prodigy and end up publishing in Nature or some other such prodigious Journal as an undergrad then you can go to where ever you want.  \n\n> Do grad schools recognize TCU?\n\nPretty much any grad school will recognized any accredited undergrad. I did my MS at TCU and did my Ph.D. at the University of Texas at Austin. I also applied to and was accepted for my Ph.D. at East Carolina University. After getting my MS at TCU I doubt there was a school that would have rejected me **because** I graduated from TCU. I probably would not have got into an Ivy League school, but that would have been more due to the research I put out... or the lack of research I put out. \n\nCan a student go from TCU to Ivy League? Yes.",

The sense of community is like no other and the administration and the students do a really good job at making new students feel like home. I came from kinda close to you (Minnesota) knowing zero people and I can honestly say I have made the best friends I have ever had. We (typically) have good sports teams. My freshman year (2017-2018) we were the only school in the country with top 15 baseball, basketball, and football teams throughout the year. \n\nWe have great business, nursing, and STEM programs. I am a communications major and I have really enjoyed my time in it. The professors are super helpful and willing to help you out in any way if you show you care and put in work. \n\nThe 100k scholarship will go a good way here. Our tuition is expensive, but in my opinion it is worth the money. We have many academic and social resources. One nice perk is \"free\" (Prepaid through tuition) admission into any TCU home sporting event. We played Ohio State in AT&T Stadium (Dallas Cowboys stadium) my sophomore year and I believe TCU students were able to get our tickets through the university like any other home game. Greek life is also a big part of our social life here. I believe over 51% of out student body is in some sort of greek life. I rushed my sophomore year and have many great friends and experiences from it. Greek life is by no means \"mandatory\" to make friends or have fun, but it is a cool way to get instantly involved in an organization on campus and make friends from all across the country. \n\nIf you have any other questions or want to know more about the university, shoot me a pm and we can talk.

        "body": "Hi! So if you are coming in as a sophomore then you will not live in a freshmen hall like Clark. All upperclassmen rooms are suites. So you'll get your own room, and you'll have three other suitemates. There's a shared living room and two bathrooms. There are a few variations, but for the most part this is how all upperclassmen suites are. When I lived in Carter I think it was overall noisier than in Marion/PE Clark. During home football games occasionally the band would warm up right outside Carter. Not sure if there will be any changes next year, but I believe Carter is now all freshmen. Since you did not get a first year experience, PE Clark may be good for you as it has both freshmen and upperclassmen rooms. That might help you to meet new people. Its right next to BLU2 (food) which is super nice. The biggest downside of Worth Hills residence halls is the distance to classes, but I usually enjoy the walk.\n\nThe commons will (if things are normal) have concerts which can be loud, but nice to watch from your window if you face the commons.  There is not much difference among commons buildings. Richards and Arnolds are the newest dorms. But all of worth hills is pretty new. Greek houses do not have parties on campus, if that's what you're worried about. Worth hills is quieter than the commons, in my opinion.",

That's why I didn't consider the Worth Hills halls in the first place. Now that I know Worth Hills is pretty nice, I will consider choosing it during the housing selection today.

Richards and Arnold is the farthest walk, but the newest. I think some of their living rooms have windows which is nice. In other dorms only the corner living rooms have windows. \n\nMarion/PE Clark is nice because it\u2019s distanced from the rest of campus, but still on the edge of the Main Campus. \n\nHonestly you can\u2019t really go wrong with the upperclassmen dorms. If money may be an issue, check in on costs of different dorms. I wanna say the commons dorms are a little bit cheaper. \n\nIf you want to feel more a part of the Main campus then I\u2019d suggest the commons dorms.

From what I can tell, you are severely limited by your studies, which understandably creates some problems. \nWhile I'm a liberal arts major and not a pre-med, my partner is a pre-med and I know that they've experienced similar issues. One of the main ways she has stayed socially active while still working is by joining study groups and finsing friends there. That would more than likely be your best bet as far as long-term success, though it would take a little work to talk to people and try to do that. \nAnother thing I would encourage you to reflect on is the time that your family takes up in your life. That seems to be another limiting factor for you, which is not the case for the average student.\nLike another Redditor said, a part-time job would also be great. I would really recommend putting in an application to Froggie 5-0 specifically because it is probably the easiest job to quit if it really doesn't end up working for you and the management is very relaxed. There are many other jobs you could pick up that require significantly more commitment, but Froggie requires relatively little. I don't if they're hiring, but I could ask my friend who is a supervisor. \nI also know of a women's health organization that is supposed to be starting up soon, which could be a great opportunity to meet new people. Feel free to DM me if you're interested so I can set you up with their President. It's supposed to be very low commitment as well.\nI empathize a lot with your situation and would be glad to help however I can.",

You do live closer to king family commons, lovingly called Bluu 2, which has significantly better food than the bluu. I\u2019ve never lived over there, but I was never interested because of how far away it is from the music building. However it\u2019s nice Bc it\u2019s close to where the marching band rehearses. You get your own parking pass there too to go in the worth hills garage. \n\nYou might like the commons dorms more because they are more central on campus with very short walks to the rec, union, class, etc. \n\nThe walk from anywhere to anywhere really isn\u2019t bad. I\u2019ve been walking more since I\u2019m a commuter and I really don\u2019t mind the walk. Except when I\u2019m running late.... \n\nThe dorms all have the same basic rules pretty much. Nothing is too strict or unreasonable! As long as your ra doesn\u2019t catch you you\u2019re fine. One of my friends had a coffee pot, waffle iron, and candles in her freshman dorm in Shirley lmao.

If you want to find devout Christian worship community at TCU, you can do that. Or if you want to find a group of people with the shared goal of promoting atheism, you can probably find that too. Most people fall somewhere in the middle.\n\nLife tip: it's important to draw wisdom from a variety of sources. If you want to receive an education based on a myopic worldview, go attend Liberty. But if you want to become a more informed, interesting, and well-rounded human being, you're going to have to broaden your horizons a little bit.\n\nFrom your post history, it seems like you're spending a lot of time worrying about the subtle differences between TCU and SMU. Don't do that. TCU and SMU are basically identical, for all practical purposes. You can make friends at both. You can have a bad experience at both. \n\nSpend more time worrying about what you want to do after college, and what your own personal goals are. College is not a place to make friends, find a spouse, or watch football. Yeah, you can do all those things in college... but you can also do all of those things while you're not in college. College is a place to get a degree in a field that you want to pursue as a career after you leave. So figure out if you want to go into finance, or engineering, or medicine, or whatever, before going to college and spending all that money for all the wrong reasons.",

It is challenging in some aspects but I mean i\u2019m sure it is everywhere. I would say most students in the BIS major are able to find a job before even graduating, this helps if you get an internship first. I was fortunate enough to receive a job offer from IBM in October 2020 so as long as you apply early you have a good chance of at least getting interviews. From there it\u2019s all up to you. Technology is the future so everyone is always looking for a technological candidate.",

        "body": "Graduated a year ago in BIS. Definitely one of the top majors in the Business School imo. Companies are looking hard for candidates with certain certs and knowledge, and the BIS major provides some of the preliminary knowledge to get those. Stuff like SQL, Basic Analytics, python etc. are in demand and you will learn all of those with the major. Once you get into the major and application process for jobs and internships, you will realize that the vast majority of the knowledge you will need for your job will need to be taught on the job and that is because everything in this field can get specific fast. Why would TCU spend the time trying to teach the latest analytics software extensively if its going to get outdated quickly. So they focus on the basics, and I mean all the basics, trying to form a foundation for you so when you do get that internship (used to be required for all BIS students, def approved of this but now its optional) you will be able to succeed. They wont miss anything you need, whether that is specific job knowledge, how to be a good communicator, how to act around clients, (Dr. Slaughter is good at explaining these soft skills), and how to deal with problems (that's why the capstone class is hard, they dont tell you shit on how to do it and you gotta figure it out creatively, like you would in the field.) \n\nWhen it comes to getting a job I don't know of any of my classmates who didnt get an offer if they at least tried to send out applications lol. If you get an internship in the summer you will be surprised how much better you are than alot of the other candidates. IMO if you take a TCU BIS kid and place him in the same team as a UT Computer Science kid, managers are going to like the TCU one. Why? Because UT Comp Science teaches hard skills and is very individualistic. The TCU one will be the leader, the innovator, the one with confidence, and a better teammate. Thats what they want, because if they need you to know a specific language they will teach it to you. They want the whole package not just a book without a directory.",

        "body": "Former StratCom major here. Like everything else it has its pros and cons, but I loved it. \n\nIt\u2019s an advertising and public relations focus. You can choose to specialize in one or the other, or you can do an integrated route. I went integrated. \n\nOther comments on this thread seem to be comparing it to marketing and are shipping Neeley, but I can tell you, as a former Neeley guy who switched to StratCom, they\u2019re wrong. Neeley will teach you how to execute, and how to do it well, but StratCom will teach you how to create and develop ideas faarrr better than the suits ever will at Neeley. I mean you\u2019ll really be able to create quality stuff and think outside of a box. \n\nStratCom will get you a great look at how the advertising world works from developing an original idea, fine tuning that idea based on your client/brand and target audience, and then how to send it off for execution. Depending on your major\u2019s pathway, it will determine if you get more of an advertising or PR outlook throughout this process. Go advertising and you\u2019ll get a nice taste of graphic design (if you want to be a graphic designer, you need to actually go major in graphic design and not StratCom) and actually executing ad campaigns. If you go PR, you\u2019ll get a real world PR campaign for a brand and research a lot of case studies (I got to sit in class with the American Airlines PR guys in charge of its rebranding process (2013-14) and even meet Mark Cuban\u2019s PR rep (with whom I still keep in touch with)).\n\nThere are some more business-esque classes (like statistics, research and evaluation, and even channel planning) but StratCom really focuses on developing/flushing out an original, creative idea and on brand development... not to mention it takes a modern approach to how the advertising world works (where you won\u2019t be forced to wear a suit or take Microsoft Excel proficiency exams). \n\nI saw someone mention it earlier in your thread, but we do have Roxo which is our student run ad agency. We also have PRSA and a few other clubs, but I was a Roxo member so I can\u2019t speak to the other clubs as much... but Roxo allowed me to join an advertising team and work with real world clients and create/execute campaigns. It\u2019s highly competitive to get into and a blast! I\u2019d recommend it for any StratCom major who wants a challenge. It\u2019s fun to deal with real world situations and possibly get the client from Hell (while you\u2019re playing with their money). You get a wonderful taste of what to expect and what happens when you\u2019re at an ad agency working with clients - speaking of which, you will have many clients that come with a job at an ad agency when you graduate. TCU has excellent ties with the DFW advertising/PR community and most of the professors are either still working in the industry at an agency or are freelancers. I don\u2019t know a single StratCom major from my class (2015) that left TCU without a job offer. Some of them have even gone on to create their own agencies and are doing very well! That alone I think testifies to how stellar the StratCom program is. \n\nOkay - enough of the positives. There are obviously negatives too. You\u2019ve seen it in this thread. People will dump on you and laugh at you thinking you\u2019re a glorified communications major who is \u201cchoosing an easy major.\u201d That couldn\u2019t be further from the truth but whatevs. You\u2019ll get to wear jeans and a t-shirt to work while they wear slacks and tie... I do know the higher ups have actually considered rebranding StratCom back to \u201cAdvertising/Public Relations\u201d because of how the title is perceived... but if you can deal with that misconception as a communication major, there are really no cons with this major.\n\nFeel free to DM me for anything else! Go Frogs!",

It\u2019s very upper crust and it was hard to keep up financially with the social scene. My friends wanted to spend the weekend going shopping, out for lunch, out for happy hour and then out to a nice dinner (and no I don\u2019t mean chili\u2019s). It was hard balancing that financially and I know SMU is no different. I will say after graduating from TCU, I struggled to find a job in Fort Worth and eventually made the move to dallas where I currently reside. One thing I wish I asked myself more before going to school was where do I want to live after? I\u2019m from houston and have family in Austin, but live in Dallas. I\u2019m here because I have a good job and some friends- but I didn\u2019t think through the longer term plan of what next. \n\nI had a great academic experience at TCU. The small class sizes were great and feel like I got a great education. I also liked Fort Worth as a city. It was small enough to feel safe, but big enough to have lots to do and different cultural experiences. TCU felt like the heart of Fort Worth and I can say that SMU doesn\u2019t feel that way with Dallas. \n\nI would suggest visiting both and asking for a private student tour. Ask where people hang out, see a dorm room, and look at Dallas hard. Because regardless of where you go, it\u2019s pretty likely you\u2019ll end up there after graduation.",

You can also expect pretty much the same quality of education if you go to UT or A&M. And while I'm not particularly fond of some of the people who attend Tech or Baylor, those are both very good schools too. You can also get a very good education at UT Arlington; or Tarleton State; or Sam Houston, etc.\n\nThe value of your degree has almost nothing to do with the school that you attend. Employers, for the most part, don't care. Your future co-workers and clients will care even less. And unless you're planning on to pursue some very elite, hyper-specific field of post-grad study, most graduate programs won't care either.\n\nRegardless of what school you go to, the one factor that determines the value of your education will be yourself. You will get out of school exactly as much as you put into it. If you study hard, make smart choices, and take the time to build yourself into an interesting and well rounded person of character, it'll pay off. \n\nUltimately the question you should be asking yourself, is not which school is best, but what do you want to do with your life \\*after\\* college? And if you don't have a good answer to that yet... then my advice would be to take a year or two off, spend some time diving into possible career options and avenues of interest... and then come back when you're a little bit better informed of who you are and what your goals are.\n\nBetter to nail down the basics first, before spending tens of thousands of dollars, right?",

TCU can offer more of the \"college experience\". In contrast, being in Dallas means that you are closer to sports stadiums, etc. (although if you have a car then you can just drive to dallas.)\n* **Transportation:** SMU gives you access to the DART, aka public transportation. Fort worth has no train system, only buses. Therefore, if you are going out places near TCU you will need someone with a car. That being said, literally everything you need is within a walking distance to TCU so you won't need a car for groceries, etc.\n   * Fort Worth is a lot easier to navigate and less stressful than Dallas\n* **Diversity:** SMU is more racially diverse than TCU, and TCU has a pretty homogenous population. However, SMU, in general, is more 'stuck up' than TCU. \n   * Both Schools have a somewhat homogenous population\n* **Academics**: There's a little bit of back in forth, but in general SMU is just slightly ahead of TCU. This doesn't really matter though since it's really just based on your programs- and neither of them are good enough to give you an advantage over someone who went to UT. \n   * *Please do your research for your major because that matters MUCH MUCH more than what school you are going to.* Some majors TCU pops off, others SMU.\n* **Cost:** In general SMU costs more than TCU, and people at SMU are more likely to be rich and stuck up about it. But PLEASE wait until financial aid comes in before making a choice because there are lots of scholarship.\n* **Social scene:** both TCU and SMU have a strong greek life presence, although for both of them you don't need to be a part of greek life in order to have a social life. I will give the edge to SMU merely because it is in Dallas and has more city stuff\n   * Both schools can be pretty crazy in terms of parties\n\nI didn't even apply to SMU, mainly because when I visited I didn't feel welcome and I felt like I was being looked down on as a middle class family, but at TCU I didn't have that problem at all.

As I've gotten older, I've grown to appreciate the value of my degree, because my time in college taught me critical thinking skills (that are under-developed in a shockingly high percentage of adults). But college isn't something you should rush in to, or be pressured to rush in to. I imagine that if you spoke to your parents about \\*why\\* you wanted to take a year or two off, what you hoped to achieve with that time, and laid out a solid plan for how to use that time to be productive, most reasonable parents would be on board with it. Taking a year off, to sit on the couch and play video games? Horrible idea. Taking a year off to get a job at a law firm, investment bank, or engineering firm? Brilliant idea. Volunteering at a non-profit, or for a social or political cause you believe in, will be a huge benefit in the long run.\n\nUnless of course, your parents are offering to pay for your entire college experience.

Some general pros are that the campus is really nice, there's good food nearby campus and just down the road in the arts district, game days are super fun, the campus vibe is pretty friendly, and there are a lot of resources for students in terms of if you need help. Aside from sports various student groups like The Crew and The End put on events throughout the year. They invite celebrities, musicians, comedians, etc.\n\nThere's a bunch of student organizations, and there's a strong Greek life presence if that's your thing. You can basically make of it what you want, you'll have lots of options.\n\nCons are of course the expense unless you get a lot of scholarships, and parking is a pain, especially on gamedays. There's usually construction somewhere on campus as well. If you're not white things can be more difficult as unfortunately there are contingents of people with antiquated views, though TCU is taking steps to improve in that area.\n\nI personally think of the three major private Christian universities in Texas (TCU, SMU, Baylor), that TCU is the best. I got a more pretentious vibe from SMU, and Baylor is more religious overall, plus it's in Waco. Fort Worth is a good town with plenty to see and do, and TCU is academically very good while still feeling pretty relaxed in terms of campus culture.",

TCU is extremely expensive and currently just doesn\u2019t seem like it\u2019s worth the price at the moment. During the fall classes will be in person only but precautions will still have to be made which include face masks, social distancing, etc. In addition, people come off as being snobby, probably because they come from wealthy families but people are typically super nice and generally good people overall. My first two years were super easy. Classes were a breeze and didn\u2019t seem to require to much work but as you get up into the 3000\u2019s and 4000\u2019s things change. When it comes to the professors, they are top notch. Professors are generally nice and since the classes are small theirs more of a one on one connection, they\u2019ll always try to help you out the best they can. The first post does a great job at explaining the area, I would just add on that the TCU has a fantastic gym and the on campus food isn\u2019t that bad and they always have a nice variety. Parking isn\u2019t really that bad anymore, especially if you live off campus, just park beside the library. Going into business school, I would recommend taking all the hands on software classes available, you\u2019ll get your Microsoft certifications but I would also take Econometrics, statistical analysis and a class or two in programming. Besides that, these classes are a breeze.",

Some extracurriculars do require a large amount of money for social events etc... and there is a pretty big gap of wealth through out the student body, but no one is going to hold that against you. But there\u2019s always a chance you might meet someone who likes to spend money or not aware of their privileges.\n\n5. Yes, but this goes for America.

        "body": "As a current senior in Greek life, it is tougher to make friends just not being involved much less than just not being in Greek life. Most of my friends who aren\u2019t in a frat/sorority have a good and wide group of friends that are in some other organization, so focus on something like that. Being in a fraternity isn\u2019t just partying too, it\u2019s learning to be in another social group, mentoring younger members, bonding as a group, and doing charity work. On being a minority, I am not one so I can\u2019t speak from experience, but I\u2019ve heard from friends of mine who are that it\u2019s been a positive experience and they\u2019re many organizations for different groups as well. I\u2019ve never had an issue or seen anything about classism/elitism here, I\u2019m certain it exists but I haven\u2019t seen any example of it first-hand. If you\u2019re a stand-up guy, people won\u2019t care about money. And as for politics, it\u2019s pretty standard: mostly conservative but the liberals who are here group together tightly in their own groups. I\u2019m a journalism major, so I tend to have far more liberals than conservatives around me, those tend to be more business majors. Either way, it tends to stay out of most classrooms, but 9/10 if it\u2019s a political classroom, it leans to the left. Hope this information helped!",

The biggest thing I'd ask you to do is *talk to your admission counselor about it!*\n\nOh, and for the process, unless you are a music major (they have different requirements), traditionally you must come to campus on Chancellor Scholar's weekend to interview! On it they had us freshman do a personal presentation and an interview. I know they had different requirements for the transfer students, but unfortunately I was unable to access the website that had it since they took it down after the weekend.  \n\n\nThis in person requirement may obviously change since COVID, but regardless, all you can do is hope and wait that you are invited to the weekend!   \n\n\nBest of luck!",

I feel a lot of people dropped the class because it was online, so yeah.  \n\n\nAlso, we were not able to get to the \"paddle\" part of the class, mainly just because it's online :(  \n\n\n**So my recommendation:**  if you want an enjoyable PE class, doing it online can work. It isn't perfect, but it was... okay. I'd recommend delaying it until after covid, to be honest. It works, but........   \n\n\nUltimately though, it's your choice. Do what you want lol.",

My husband said he was so tempted to rip the nearby iced tea canister off the counter and teach the kid a thing or two about gratitude.\n\nMost of the students I interact with as an employee are nice and well-intentioned, if slightly oblivious about cultures and socio-economic groups other than their own, but the few total self-centered idiots are...memorable.",

My personal recommendation (of course) is that you take the chance to go to TCU because it's STEM programs are well above adequate, and unless you're going to something like MIT or at the very least Rice level, very few employers will care where you get your degree came from, only the connections you have. \n\nHaving a full ride will definitely help you get tons of connections throughout the university.\n\nThat being said, if you are just trying to get in and get out with a degree as fast as possible, I think UTA would probably be the best for that.

Living off campus, especially during covid, probably means that it will be very difficult to make friends. \n\nThings I would recommend doing: joining a club, sport or faith group. This is way easier than you'd think. When I was doing it at the start I was super worried that I'd be judged, or be the new person on the team, and I didn't have that much experience. Turns out that I was just able to show up, and there were a lot of people with the same idea! I legit joined a group that I was involved in the whole semester by playing volleyball with someone the first week of school, then I joined their group, and .. yeah. \n\nBut don't be worried if you don't find someone you love the first week of school! You can figure stuff out, meet new people everywhere, and make new friends super easily.  Go to dorm events if you have them.\n\nEspecially regarding covid, it's harder than ever to make friends on TCU's campus, just because- with me personally, I had all online classes, so I was never able to see most of the people in my classes. Some of my best friends (and romantic partner) I have classes with, so it was really helpful to meet up with some of my online classmates IRL. Half of the time that was as easy as seeing them somewhere and being like \"wait are you ...?\"  \n\n\nIf you're a bit of a wallflower- like I assume you might be because ... reddit... there are still tons of people like you, and its easy to make friends still. You just have to put yourself out there.   \n\n\nIn terms of the dating scene.. well, the 60/40 ratio is real. If you're a typical tcu girl then you might have trouble finding someone for a committed long term relationship. That can lead to some hookups and thats not necessarily a good thing...   \nIf you're a guy though and looking for a girl, you gotta shoot your shot! You can sometimes land with someone who might be a bit out of your league just because of that 60/40 ratio",

        "body": "So, TCU is a private university near a big city, which tends to mean that there a lot of wealthy students, which I would say defines the culture at TCU a lot. I don't think it's anywhere near as bad as someplace like SMU in terms of snootiness, but some people can be very privileged. In my experience, mostly this just translates into the enormous presence of Greek life, a notoriously expensive activity, which about 50% of the campus participates in. The culture of Fort Worth affects the experience a lot too. I've lived in the DFW metroplex my whole life, so I'm more used to it than other people, but there are quite a few cowboy-themed things that students might get into early on, like going to Billy Bob's frequently.\nIf you're coming to visit during December, a lot of the cool stuff that you'd normally be able to tour and see, like the Rec and the Library which both wowed me when I visited, will be unavailable. The campus is pretty small, so you could probably walk around the whole thing in about and hour or two. If I were you, I would try visiting some cool areas in Fort Worth if you haven't already, like Sundance Square and Downtown Fort Worth, the Stockyards, as well as restaurants like Dutch's or anything on W. 7th Street, like Rodeo Goat. I wish there was more available for you to see, but the campus is going to be essentially a ghost town by then, so a basic walk around the campus won't give you the impression of the student experience that I know you're probably looking for.",

In my experience our veteran society is pretty good, those I have talked to speak highly of it. I have a few contacts I can send you if you want to know more about it. Like the previous reply said, we are a yellow ribbon school.\n\nWe have many cadets in our ROTC program who are SMP cadets and drill with local units and they seem to have no problems handling their national guard or reserve commitment. We have two guys that are a nursing and mechanical engineering major respectively and they have done well with the balance. One of my buddies is commissioning as a 67J medevac pilot on Blackhawks into Texas National Guard this May. I bet he would love to talk to you if you are willing. \n\nAs far as dating, I can't speak much to people in your situation, but a Navy veteran buddy of mine met his current girlfriend here a year or two ago. \n\nI wish I would have seen this post earlier. Good luck with everything and I hope you decide to come to TCU. Coming here was one of the best decisions of my life. Feel free to reach out if you have any other questions.",

Luckily, everyone was pretty friendly, but I worked my way through school, so most of my friends were from work and whoever was tight with my roommates. I also made friends from class - speaking of which, classes could rock your world as the professors definitely want you to earn your grade. The education is top notch as a result and sets you up well to succeed after graduation. \n\nFort Worth is a super cool city on the up. There\u2019s good food and cool places to hang out (whether you\u2019re 21 or not). Arlington is close by if you\u2019re into pro sports, as is Dallas if you\u2019re into live music (which Fort Worth has too). You will get homesick. It\u2019s not a quick hop in the car to get home, but if you can overcome that feeling, you\u2019ll have a blast.\n\nGo Frogs!\n\nEdit: autocorrect spelling",

When I rushed fall of \u201803 as a freshman there were only like 2 or 3 (out of 200+) dudes that got \u201cblack-balled\u201d (no bids), and they were super fucking weird so it wasn\u2019t surprising. If it went well for you talking to people during rush then I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s cause there were fewer new members taken and most of those spots were pretty much filled a while back and/or by guys who already knew each other and whatnot. They way you\u2019re describing your rush experience I highly doubt you got \u201cblack-balled\u201d. I think you\u2019re a victim of timing. You\u2019ll make other friends if you\u2019re looking to, and if you still want to join next semester or year then try again. By then you might have made a group of friends and not even want to rush again anyway. I think the social scene there now is a lot less dependent on frats as it was when I was there. When I was there if you weren\u2019t in a frat it was pretty sparse as far as parties went and there was almost zero chance non frat members were allowed in frat parties unless you were really tight with someone (which meant you\u2019d usually end up joining that frat anyway).

I expect that once all the people partying have recovered and have antibodies (potentially) herd immunity is gonna be better and it's going to be a constant slow down over time. People have also figured out that getting tested off campus is a better way to approach the problem as you won't be counted in TCU's count which will be the main factor of their decision to keep the school going in person. Also, from personal experience, my classes that are in person are consistently less than or at 25% full. People are just preferring to zoom in instead for safety reasons or to avoid the walk.",

Following the TCU dashboard the isolation beds are now 42% available ( that number will change this week dramatically). While I agree that it is not wise to send students packing I know that if isolation beds run out, they have to send kids home for their own safety. Following the increase in numbers we will probably have around 700+ cases on campus this week almost doubling our total now. To sum up, I think the concept of limited isolation beds will send kids home alone because not everyone has a suite style dorm and TCU cannot risk the health of residence halls workers or dinning staff",

My roommate at the time, who was a member, came home early one night a little peeved. I asked him what was up, and he said the BYX root beer kegger got shut down by FWPD because they wouldn\u2019t believe that they were all actually drinking root beer, despite being offered more than one cup to taste.\n\nAnyway, though my experience is obviously a bit of date, there are plenty of religious organizations of various stripes on campus. BYX and whatever the female equivalent is (can\u2019t remember the name) are large and very active. There are also other groups both large and small.",

You get a somewhat sorority experience without the drinking  and crazy partying. My experience was incredible in this organization \n\nHowever, there are also a ton of other experiences as well. There is an organization called Delight. There\u2019s Young Life.

There were a few people who ended up coming out after pledgeship, and it really didn't change the way anyone felt about them. At the end of the day, you're still brothers.\n\nJust know that being gay is targetable the exact same way they will look for other things to bring people down about in that pledgeship semester.

I was friends with a guy who convinced me to go just because there was nothing else to do the week before school started. I ended up rushing and i\u2019m incredibly glad I did. Some people aren\u2019t into the whole fraternity thing but now I advise people to rush because that\u2019s how i felt too. Going through pledge-ship, you get to be really close with the guys in your pledge class and chapter. If one of my pledge brothers were to be gay, I wouldn\u2019t care and neither would the vast majority of the guys. I think any respectable chapter would feel the same. I know of guys that are openly gay, I also know of guys who are not openly gay and only a few people know about it. Either way, if you find the right fraternity you will be fine. Obviously it\u2019s your job to go to different rush events to get the feeling of whether you could see yourself being comfortable around those people. You can absolutely find a good place for yourself in a fraternity if that\u2019s what you really want. Plus at the end of the day, you can always decide to drop or not accept a bid, assuming you\u2019ve been offered one. \nAs for price, that\u2019s something you should ask rush chairs or other brothers while at a rush event because every fraternity varies. Sororities are typically cheaper because they have a lot more people and they spend less on social events. Those are probably the two biggest factors.",

        "body": "Yeah, to get a partial scholarship you\u2019re most likely gonna need a decent improvement in your SAT score. If money is in any way a factor you should take the advice of the two previous commenters; do your first couple of years at a junior/community college, whatever they\u2019re called these days. You\u2019ll miss out on the true freshman/sophomore college experience going that route, but you have to decide if that experience is worth 100 grand to you/your family. Also keep in mind any scholarship you get will probably have a requirement that you keep a GPA above 3.25 at the lowest, probably 3.5. I was a freshman in fall of \u201803, and I received a partial academic scholarship (I didn\u2019t apply for it or anything). I had to be in the \u201chonors\u201d program which stipulated taking some honors classes and keeping a 3.5 minimum GPA. That didn\u2019t happen, I partied balls a had a 2.5 (2 B\u2019s and 2 C\u2019s) first semester. I only took 12 hours cause I had started with 27 hours from high school dual-credit and AP bullshit. The scholarship was only somewhere between 35/40 thousand in totality also....wasn\u2019t even worth a year. So even if you do get a scholarship don\u2019t expect it to be worth more than a year, if it\u2019s even worth that much. I had one high school friend which got basically the same deal as me, so while everyone\u2019s situation is different and that was a long time ago I think that\u2019s a kind of standard set up. Also just so you have a little more info for comparison, I had a 32 on my ACT and a 1320 on my SAT, this was back when 1600 was a perfect score. I have no idea how that translates to the current scoring system. My friend had the same ACT score but like a 1400 something SAT. Good luck no matter how it plays out or what school you end up at, I hope shit goes well for you.",

        "body": "Bro, you're way ahead of where I was and, you should def get in, though I was slightly nepotistic (Family worked at TCU, but I failed to get in my freshman year, transferred in from TCC with As in those classes). But you likely will need the SAT. \n\nThere is a minority population, there are some issues that they have brought up, as a white guy it's hard for me to disagree with them as I did not have that experience. I do know that many people will assume you're some sort of athlete, with that said athletes were never looked down upon amongst anyone I ever hung out with so it wasn't necessarily a negative stereotype, though it was shoehorning you in.\n\nWith that said, in most groups I saw there were minorities, it was usually just a few though. Most of the athletes stayed together so when I hung out with them there were black people there. Though non-black POC tended to be more spread out. Also generally every person I hung out with was super chill and I never saw any overt racism, there was a cloud over some of the general frats but nothing I could specifically speak to as I wasn't in a frat, and really it likely could have been helped by simply having more black men in frats so they were less insular racially. Though realistically they have a stand-offish vibe to anyone not in their frat or in a frat overall so some of it could be from that alone. \n\nI can't speak to the dorms, I didn't live on campus until my junior year.\n\nMost students stayed on campus, a sizeable minority commuted. Some people went home some weekends.\n\nYou can walk around all you want, though with COVID there might be some policies. Also they gave out tours like candy, though with COVID that might be cut down. The admissions department can set that up. I'd offer to give you an unofficial tour but the COVID stuff has really locked stuff down.\n\nI will say to get involved and join groups, if you're athletic join club sports or possibly the cheer squad (I was a part of the spirit org), they make good friends and you'll get to travel. Or if you're not join some other student organizations. The worst thing you can do in college is not be involved in as much as you can.",

If there are alumni in your local area I\u2019m sure they\u2019d love to help as well. \nI\u2019d also reach out to someone from the office of financial aid and scholarship office to see what advice they have.\nTCU is a private school so they can be lenient and give out money without a set standard.

Since it's a small department they really take the time to get to know you personally and help you throughout college. If you are passionate about anthropology I would definitely recommend sticking with it. I came in as a anthro freshman and wasnt so sure about it at first but the professors passion for the subject really fueled my own enthusiasm. Since it's a liberal art, studying anthropology builds foundational skills like writing, critical thinking, and problem solving etc. that employers really want to see. It's a very open major with plenty of employment options, but if you're really worried about that sort of thing I would recommend maybe minoring, or even double majoring, in something like business as a safe backup since it pairs well with anthro. The anthro major requirements are pretty flexible, most majors are double majors. I was able to fit two minors into my schedule with extra space for electives. (Also, speaking as the former president, the Anthropological society is a great organization for making friends and get to know other people and profrssors within your major since there are so few at TCU)",

I did major in Anthropology and it was the only major that did not change, freshman to senior year. I loved it. Class sizes were small, the professors were amazing, and you won\u2019t have more interesting classes or reading in any other discipline. I think it\u2019s worth it, and I do still use it in my life and career (I graduated 5 years ago). However, be forward thinking too\u2014it\u2019s not so easy to get a job with just an anthro degree. I think my post-grad trajectory has been kind of unique and fortunate among my classmates. My advice is to do lots of internships and jobs\u2014every summer, most semesters. This will help you know what you want to do when you\u2019re done and make you a lot more marketable. I\u2019d also encourage double majoring with something tangible, like the marketing you mentioned. Definitely doable with the number of hours required for anthro. And! If you get a chance, do an anthro thesis, just because it\u2019s really fun.",

It was incredible. Had so much fun. You\u2019ll have to take a class with Dr. Aftandillian. Awesome guy. I originally came to TCU as a computer science major. Did that for 3 semesters and backed out. Switching majors is really easy. It\u2019s not like public universities where you have to be accepted into each college at the university. To my understanding once you\u2019re in you\u2019re in. \n\nI will say though, I loved my degree but I am currently a high school chemistry teacher. If that tells you anything. I wouldn\u2019t say it wasn\u2019t useful, as it definitely allowed me to become a more educated and informed citizen and look at things from a centered perspective, but there wasn\u2019t a lot I could do without grad school. I would love to get a job in sociology with my bachelors degree (that isn\u2019t social work). \n\nIf you\u2019re planning to go to grad school, then awesome! Do what you love. I only took 1 class for my major I didn\u2019t find amazing. I just want you to have proper expectations about post college life if you major in anthropology without higher education.",

However, I am not sure if grad schools even care if I double majored in something that is not related together. I know that GPA does matter a lot tho. I just do not want to spread myself too thin. Yet, I do want some business classes still because you are right it is a very useful skill to have. And I really want my minor in Spanish too because I can get it in one year with my Ap credits. So my problem is I have no idea how I am going to be able to do all of this in 4 years and still have some type of social life and be able to go to sporting events. Also with internships and jobs.

I\u2019ve had a mix of crazy hard classes and easy A\u2019s both in and out of my major (nursing major, sociology minor). This IS a private institution though and they WILL hold you to a high standard, but the TCU degree and merit that follows (in some cases) will reflect that. However, I think if you\u2019re smart enough to get in then you\u2019ll do fine. The university offers a crazy amount of support and resources, and most professors genuinely want you to pass. The small classes help too. Occasionally you\u2019ll get a lecture hall course with 70+ people in it but most of the courses are around 30. That really helps with in-class interactions with the instructor and building relationships with classmates who can help you. \n\nI think it\u2019s important to say though that college and high school are very different feels and practicing time management is the most important thing, especially your first/freshman year. Nobody will hold you responsible for getting your work done, most of your prof\u2019s wont even mention you not doing it, you\u2019ll just see it reflected in the grade book. The intensity of a class is generally what you make of it, and it\u2019ll help your stress a ton if you spread out your studying (advice given from a chronic procrastinator), so an intense class may not seem so bad to you as it would someone else. \nI\u2019d also recommend giving RateMyProfessor a visit and they\u2019ll help you find what you\u2019re really looking for in a course.",

I was in Milton and all the friends I have now (graduated in 2015) are from Milton. I did end up rushing again sophmore year fall, because one of my friends from milton was in a house I really liked and basically gave my roommate and I bids. I liked being in a sorority but never really got ingrained into the community, and I even lived in the house for a semester and was on the exec board. \n\nI'd say if you don't want to rush, don't. It's a harrowing process, I think it's up to 5 or 6 days now and you're out there in August all day long, standing for most of it. You can make friends in lines and small groups, but it's definitely not the only way. TCU works really hard to offer other hang out times for people not rushing. I went to frog camp and definitely recommend it, as well as Frogs first and all the other big freshman year events, especially the ones in your dorm. And you'll be able to befriend people that did rush, and they can invite you to the greek parties and stuff. \n\nGreek life is pretty big, I'd say it felt like 80% of the population was wearing greek letters freshman year, but a lot of people drop out, and I'm pretty sure the number is actually much lower than that.

TCU is going to afford you the more \"quintessential\" smaller town college experience, where as SMU feels more like it is part of a major metro area. \n\nSMU will afford you more access to major city amenities such as concerts and sporting events, but those are just a short drive from TCU as well. \n\nTCU sports are better than SMU's, and TCU is part of the Big 12 while SMU is in the american. TCU will. again, be a bit more traditional in terms of getting to travel down to Austin or Waco for a football game. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nLet me know if there are any other questions I can answer, I'm happy to help!",

It\u2019s just going to come down to the environment you prefer - I think the quality of education you\u2019ll get at either will be comparable at the undergraduate level. But if you like being at the heart of a bustling urban center - SMU is a great choice. Central Dallas life is fast moving and just like what you\u2019d expect in a major city. SMU\u2019s right next to Highland Park, which is one of the wealthiest cities in America; the culture on campus will likely reflect this. TCU\u2019s a bit slower, a bit more relaxed. It retains that small town charm because it\u2019s a smaller campus - but Fort Worth in general is like this. I\u2019d think the stereotypical \u201ccollege experience\u201d would be better served by TCU than SMU. When you no longer have to live on campus, home prices / rent rates will be lower around TCU than SMU I have no doubt. Also, if you\u2019re at all into football, or at least casually, then TCU is definitely better.",

You can make it more central if that is important to you, but University of Dallas and SLU place a higher importance on religion. SLU has the bonus of having a campus in Madrid, but every school you listed has study abroad opportunities. Location wise, Fort Worth and St. Louis would take the top two spots for me. SMU would be 3rd for me just based on Dallas traffic alone. UD is in Irving, meaning it doesn\u2019t have a whole lot else going on, but the train does run right by campus.",

TCU is great if you want to eventually end up in education but out of the classroom. If you wanted to teach STEM, UT Dallas could be good as well. SMU and UDallas are good schools, but not particularly known for producing classroom teachers.\n\nTCU has a few programs where you can go straight into a master's degree program, which is perfect if you want to do something in education that requires advanced degrees, like becoming a counselor or professor.  \n\nIf funding your education isn't an issue, TCU could be a good choice. As a public school teacher in DFW, you can expect to start at about $55k per year. Some of the private schools you mentioned offer generous scholarships, so it could be cheaper for you to go there instead a a public school. \n\nIn my opinion (shared by many colleagues), what matters most in teacher education is time spent in the classroom. The best programs will have pedagogy and theory classes taught by excellent professors, support from veteran teachers, and early/consistent time in classrooms. \n\ntl;Dr consider ROI, time in the classroom, and your long-term career goals when choosing a teacher education program.",

The social scene is fairly diverse although the Greek community is much larger than the average school.  The school is about 10K students which is smaller than the big state schools here (30-40K) but definitely not small (eg, TLU @ 3K).  The school is very good at many sports (mainly football and baseball being the popular ones) so that\u2019s a fun scene if you enjoy that.  A good party scene for sure with lots of local bars (walkable!) but I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s a party school like Texas State, although that usually correlates opposite of education quality, so I would say it\u2019s a good happy medium.  Again, a lot of the party scene is going to be organized by fraternities/sororities, but there are definitely plenty of scenes outside of that too.\n\nEducation wise it\u2019s above average and the student to professor ratio is very good, so if you combine that with the great amenities and resources available, you can make it a strong scholastic experience.  The city itself is great, very middle of the road politically with a great mix and \u201cold school\u201d Texas style and modern, trendy areas.  Given it\u2019s an expensive private school, it\u2019s not the most diverse school (if that matters to you) but there are tons of scholarships and international students.  Generally a lot of people here have a ton of money (both the school and city) but my experience was it wasn\u2019t as gaudy or highlighted as somewhere like SMU.  Can\u2019t help you much on Biology and other education items specifically, but their career services got me into the job I wanted and nowadays when I hire people I have a good impression of TCU graduates.",

The premed faculty are very helpful and made things a lot easier for us compared to other schools.  I found this out during med school hearing my friends talk about their experiences.  They make shadowing easy. There are plenty of research opportunities if you want them.  The faculty are also there to teach, research is a secondary goal.  I know other big schools the faculty really only care about research and getting a research spot can be difficult because all the phD students and post-docs.  One other plus is TCU is pretty easy to navigate, the main obstacle you'll deal with on a day-to-day basis is crossing University Drive haha.

The Chancellor's Scholarship is the full ride one, but to be honest, it's very competitive. As for financial aid, I suggest filling out College Board's CSS profile if you don't have an SSN since FAFSA requires one.\n2. TCU costs \\~$64,000 for both tuition & room/board per year with no scholarship/financial aid. However, $20,000 will definitely works if you get a full ride since it costs around $15,000 for dorm + meal plan and other expenses.\n\nGood luck!

We found that many are willing to pay for a self-guided, walking tour because it allows them to tour at their convenience and at their own pace. It also allows them to tour campus from the perspective of a student similar to them. For example, a high school student interested in majoring in Economics, greek life, and the Consulting club would find a tour created by a college student with similar interests. The high school student would purchase the tour, put in their earbuds, blend into the campus, and listen to the college student\u2019s tour while walking the directions from point to point.

My guess is that it\u2019s bc military is like one large fraternity. \n\nJust rush and go with your gut. If you feel it makes sense and is a good fit, your age won\u2019t make a difference. \n\nMy only advice though is to disclose your age in an appropriate manner to any of the sorority girls you come across while considered a \u201cpledge\u201d. Of course, don\u2019t lead off with it. But trust your gut on when it\u2019s appropriate. Keep in mind that many of the girls you\u2019ll initially encounter will be 18, since you tend to hang out with those going through similar experiences (rushing and pledging), and it can come off as creepy if you aren\u2019t honest about something some people might consider taboo. (I.e. 6 year gap in age 18-24). \n\nHope this helps and don\u2019t hesitate to DM if you have any questions or if I can be of help in any other way.\n\nGo Frogs!",

But I was able to get over it pretty quickly looking back. First I would suggest going to Frog Camp in the summer. Honestly I thought it was extremely corny but I met a lot of friends there and it forced me out of my comfort zone. Going into my first semester I felt like I already had a head start knowing some people. Second thing I would suggest is to look into joining a club that fits your interests or even your major/minor if you've decided already. It's a lot easier to make friends when you all have shared interests. Personally I joined the Rugby team and the Student Film Association. Most people gravitate to wanting to join a fraternity/sorority but that wasn't for me so I can't give you any advice there. They usually have a big Activities Fair at the beginning of the semester you should check out. TCU and Ft Worth can seem huge and overwhelming coming from a small town but I promise you'll adjust quickly. Suprisingly it's actually a pretty tight community especially compared to much bigger schools like UT Austin.",

In my first year, whenever I wore TCU shirts off campus (and TCU had a lot of events with free shirts) I'd have random people throw me a \"go frogs\" or ask me about the various sports teams and games. TCU and Fort Worth also have a partnership called go purple fridays where you get discounts for wearing purple on fridays before football games in an attempt to get the whole city to wear purple. It really helps you feel like you're part of the city. \n\nAnd in terms of Frog Camp, they're all great, but they do have one specifically geared toward out of state people called CASA and they take you to a bunch of Fort Worth gems and you'll meet a ton of other out of state people. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo excited you're joining the frog fam!!

I graduated a few years ago so hopefully this is all still accurate. \n\nOut of state: TCU has a lot of out of state students, so don't worry feeling like you wont fit in. My experience was that out of staters are primarily from CA, but I met a decent number from CO, MO, and OK. \n\nFrog Camp: I would 100% recommend going to frog camp. I did Challenge, which was... OK. If you have the opportunity I think you should do one of the frog camps that go abroad. When I was a student, there was one in Rome for honors students and one in the UK for \"Leaders.\" If you want to meet other out of staters or people new to the area, casa nueva was cool because it introduced you to fort worth. You will probably do all the same things over your four years at TCU, but it could be fun to get a head start. Alpine, where you go up into the mountains, also looked really fun. I played it safe and did challenge, but I would strongly recommend that you consider the others. Challenge has the most kids but you can also get caught up in the shuffle \n\nClubs/Greek Life: Don't feel the need to rush your first semester because it feels like everyone else is. Like the above comment said, there are numerous clubs and activities where you can meet people. My experience with rushing as a male is that a large portion of the bids were given over the summer, so by the time you get to Texas, you are at a disadvantage because the locals have been partying with the fraternities for the whole summer and you are just getting to campus. Sorority rush is much more formal and designed so that every girl has her little interviews, but who knows. I think if I did it all over again, I might have waited unto the spring to rush? Not sure how that would have gone for me. All that to say, I did ultimate frisbee, water polo, rugby, and some other clubs. Those were excellent ways to meet people, and I don't feel like I missed out on anything because I wasn't in a greek org.  \n\nMy number one piece of advice is to remember that everyone is in the same boat as you. It will seem like some people aren't struggling at all, but everyone left home, everyone has to make new friends, everyone has to adjust to the new campus, etc. Move at your own pace, don't feel like you need to be doing everything as slow or as fast as others. Finally, don't be afraid to just stop hanging out with people. Your first group of \"friends\" might not be as good a fit as you initially think. ",

Offering a different viewpoint and exposing college students to that should not be deemed offensive. It's a good thing. There are protesters/political people on that stretch of sidewalk all the time (at least when I went to TCU), and I don't remember TCU having to clarify their viewpoints on the issues.\n\nPeople are quick to dismiss him as a some right-wing nut who is only filming to get trigger fodder in his videos, but I actually think he is pretty fair. He turns it into a conversation instead of a bunch of \"gotchas\". The only reason people made a big deal out of was because a couple of students who are taking criminal justice classes (an actual reference to the first girl in the video) who made emotional outburts at him without taking the second to hear him out.\n\nAlso, not to be nit picky, but Crowder says that rape culture doesn't exist. TCU says that they don't agree with Crowder. So TCU admits that their campus is a culture of rape? Listen to what the dude says before you dig in on your uniformed opinions!",

Sherley is more open and separates guys and girls communities, Moncrief has alot of athletes, Milton has all the honors students, Colby is all girls so a lot more drama lol, and both Waits and Foster are similar in their layout and general \"closed offness\" if thats a word. I had a triple in Waits but I cant remember if it was extended or not (if you got a discount on the price we had the same thing). Honestly our setup was pretty cramped compared to other rooms but we still had the biggest room compared to the doubles. The suit bathroom is nice but is only cleaned every 2 weeks compared to the common bathrooms so thats a personal preference there if ya use it. Advice I would give is loft you bed as high as it can go/your comfortable with and setup your desk AND Chair underneath (like I did here https://imgur.com/a/5zWQgoY). Convince your roommates to set up the beds on the 2 walls and in-front of the window and put one of your dressers in the closet to save space.",

My absolute best advice would be start making contact with the admissions counselor from your area and set up a phone call or Skype session seeing as they have the power to put you in front of the admissions committee and if you leave a lasting impression on the counselor the will vouch for your admission. Also try to get more involved around your school as well as leadership roles, those went a long way in my admission decision. Next year they will be taking away the early action option for application so if you\u2019re dead set on going to TCU I\u2019d highly recommend apply early decision with the binding contract. DO NOT BS YOUR ESSAYS!!!! They will look at your essays closely to learn more about you and the information that was overshadowed in your application. My final bit would be try to do the freedom of expression (which is optional) however it gives them even more insight as to who you are as a person and not so much just an application. \nGood luck with your application because acceptance is getting harder and harder with more people applying!",

        "body": "I\u2019m talking most directly about your TCU admissions counselor, however the application is a bit strenuous and requires a fair amount of high school counselor involvement. In high school I didn\u2019t have the best grades I had a 3.7 ending GPA and scored a 28 on the ACT, but I had a lot of extra curriculars including, but not limited to; 4 year football team captain, 1st team all district in football, 4 year varsity letter winner, founding member of mentors in violence prevention, founder and leader of fellowship of Christian athletes, and a 7 time recipient of the IHSAA honors in academic distinction award. I would recommend putting at least a month of well thought out work into your essay as well as taking it to a few language arts teachers for spell check, content quality, and overall thoughts/opinions. Also, get in well with a particular teacher between now and your senior year as you will need them to fill out a teacher evaluation of things like overall attitude, class participation, and classroom leadership. This teacher evaluation and also the high school counselor evaluation tell the admission committee a lot about what you\u2019re like around your high school. Grades are not the only thing the university focuses on and I think TCU\u2019s application provides you a great platform to display everything that is important to you outside of your academic achievements. \nIf you have anymore questions feel free to let me know, the application process was a long and difficult road for me but you\u2019ll get through it.

I highly recommend doing the optional portions of the application as it displays your work ethic and how bad you truly want to be a horned frog!

TCC (our juco) and TCU work closely together in ensuring that most credits will transfer over, and TCU can be very generous with transfer scholarships (https://financialaid.tcu.edu/transfer-academic-scholarships/). \n\nHowever, even the best scholarship is only $22,000. Off campus can drop your bill but 10-12k also. So when the cost of attendance sitting at $62,000, you can save yourself $34,000. FAFSA could help lower taht up to an additional $6,000, but if you're relying on that $6,000, I wouldn't recommend the  third most expensive degree in Texas.\n\nWithout FAFSA, you'd pay $28,000 for a degree.

Get to know them! They are incredibly helpful with the course stuff and outside of class. I keep in close contact with two, who helped me with decisions after TCU. ",

That said, I went to frat parties with friends who were members and went as a date with girls to their sorrority parties, so I was able to participate in spite of not being a member.  Anything official for TCU itself would not require you to be in a sorrority and thus you wouldn't miss anything there.  The value of a frat or sorrority (to me) is a built-in friend group as you immediately have something in common, but obviously people make friends without that advantage so it's not necessary.\n\nAs for opportunities, there may be networking advantages to Greek life, but I have done well without and the advantage would likely be minimal.\n\nI think it comes down to personality in the end.  I am not and never have been interested in the concept of the Greek groups, so not going that route was a non issue.  You won't miss out on anything if you don't do it, but if the idea of Greek life is appealing then obviously the thing you would miss out on is the Greek experience.\n\nThis will be the same at any school, though, to varying degrees.  No school experience would be made or broken by Greek life, so it has to come down to what fits you best.",

I think my gf paid something like a grand in dues every year but that is going to depend on the sorority and it may very well be higher so take that with a large grain of salt. Girls pay a lot more than guys but get a lot of free food and clothes and shit so its not for nothing. I don't know about the other costs, but you may have to buy some decently nice dresses for rush if you don't have them already. If you shop smart or already have them that shouldn't be a huge problem I wouldn't think. I also don't know what kind of application costs may be required but you can probably google those pretty easily. \n\nI didn't know many girls who were putting themselves through rush (or paying for much of anything) but I only really hung out with two sororities - I'm sure you'll be able to figure out which ones I'm talking about pretty quickly. There are definitely going to be some where you're gonna run into girls who don't understand that you can't do fancy dinners and brunches multiple times a week or go to expensive events. BUT rush will do a good job of sorting that out for you. Despite all the crap sorority rush entails it is fucking *thorough*. You'll quickly find out where you won't fit in and where none of that will matter at all. If you want to be in a sorority then you're going to find at least one place you'll fit in after a week of getting to know them. \n\nWorst case, if you rush and hate all the sororities and don't feel comfortable, you won't be alone and you should meet others in your same boat. Nobody feels comfortable in rush and every single girl bitches about how stressful it is putting on their best faces for a week. If you feel like you're sticking out TRUST ME nobody will notice because they're all too busy trying their hardest to fit in too\n\nGo Frogs\n\n*EDIT: also a fuck ton of scholarships are available that go unused at TCU. Since a lot of people don't have to worry about finances there tons are available. I was shocked when I found out the extent of them being unused, so I highly recommend you check those out. Im sure there's something dedicated specifically for girls in sororities",

I know Phi Lamb has lower dues if Christianity is your thing or there are the sororities under the NPHC and the MGC (google those for the page with more info).

Also TCU might have an age rule that would let you live off campus regardless of what year you transfer in as a credit student. I.e. you are 20 years old or 21 so you can live off campus even if you are a credit level soph. (if all your credits don't transfer).

I also was raised with a lot of longhorn influence. After touring colleges as a senior in high school, I enjoyed UT\u2019s campus, and I enjoyed the whole feel. However, TCU provided so much more of a sense of belonging to me, I knew if I attended, the identity of a horned frog would resonate with so much more weight than it would if I belonged anywhere else. It is much easier to get involved and make an impact at TCU than most other places, it\u2019s a place that can truly make you feel important, and a place that you can find your passion. I know a lot of people frequently use the argument about the faculty to student ratio and the quality of the faculty, and I\u2019m not sure how much that means to you, but I will tell you that it is immensely important. On average, my classes generally have about 20-25 students in them, which is smaller than what my classes were like in high school. TCU is stacked with super helpful and greatly qualified professors that really want to see you succeed, and that will get to form a personal connection with you and get to know you, which I\u2019ve heard from friends and faculty is very uncommon at large universities, specifically UT.

Working with graduate assistant Jessica Webb and Senior Archivist Mary Saffell, the students utilized records in the TCU library\u2019s Special Collections, the student newspaper The Skiff, and the TCU Horned Frog yearbook.  Each student selected her or his topic, conducted the research, selected the featured images, and wrote the text.

Pretty much can't go wrong with any establishment on that street although my favorites are Bearded Lady, Heim, and Cane Rosso. Best sports bar? Buffalo Bros literally across the street from TCUs campus.  Also dive bar? University Pub, literally right next door to Buffalo Bros.",

That being said, if you can't do it against this level of competition, you don't have a prayer against OK State/etc.\n\nThis was a passing game that felt a lot like a \"good Kenny\" game from last year. He was generally accurate and making good decisions, though that interception was thrown into triple coverage so I'm not sure what he was thinking there. The main thing was just not dropping the ball. That being said, did anyone even have more than three catches? I'm still twitchy after the debacle that was last year; this game didn't end that.\n\nRunning game looked good. Blocking wasn't perfect but Anderson was pretty impressive. I like the idea of interspersing Snell with Turpin for that speed back type role, given how many hits Turpin took past year. Hoped for a little more out of Sewo, honestly. His vision was good but didn't seem to run through arm tackles like I wanted him to.\n\nI felt like defense was where we saw the biggest talent gap. Our guys, especially the line, just overpowered them most of the time. Particularly impressed with Arico Evans. Felt a lot like a few years back when we were looking for that guy to step up after the Williams/Washington/Carder years and Dawson seemed to come out of nowhere. Liked the progression from Issahaku compared to last year. Cautiously optimistic on the defensive line if we don't have any more injuries but even in that game it felt a little thin - not as much rotation as the other position groups but could just be me.\n\nOverall, great game, only a couple mistakes (obviously) but my two biggest things were thank God for a kicker and the future looks super bright even if it's not this year. Our kids have a lot of potential.",

Ultimately, we have one of the deepest running games in the country (imo) and Hicks is an absolute game changer. Cumbie will open up the pass with these guys and let Hicks get the touches he never got under DM. Meacham never let Hicks get those consistent touches and became far too predictable with his pass-first (only) offense. Cumbie won't stray from this, but when it makes sense to run, he's gonna let Hicks eat. Open up the run game, make the safeties respect it and Turpin will absolutely feast on man coverage. I'm not worried about Kenny, he was never our problem- though he was far from a strength. These two guys can feed off eachother, and if we play to their strengths we can make some noise.  ",

You can always go in and ask for help, and they are genuinely excited to see you. It's pretty hard since you'll have to take almost an equal number of electrical and mechanical classes, and most mechanical brains have trouble understanding electrical. But again the teachers are there to help. If there is any advice I can give you, it's take any class with either Bittle or Williamson, and become best friends with the engineering secretary, Mrs. Berry. \n\nSome of my best friends were in the engineering department and since the class size is so small, you'll pretty much become friends with everyone, and see everyone all the time. Once you become a sophmore/junior, you'll be in the engineering building (and become obsessed with it) way more than you'll probably want and so will every other engineer. So if you want a social scene there, it's yours for the taking. Plus the engineers usually have a big party once a semester, so don't be afraid of making friends with engineers in the years above you so they invite you ;) \n\nI did do greek life, but it wasn't a huge part of my life like many at TCU. If you don't focus on it, you'll end up surrounded by others who don't as well, and your social life will build itself. If you focus on it, or how you didn't get in, or didn't pledge, or how everyone you seem to know is in Greek, then you'll miss these people I'd say. Not to sound too doomsday/philosophical. \n\nAnd I love talking about TCU and engineering there if you ever need more help or sage advice!",

For the most part they shouldn't have been in a difficult major to begin with though. \n\nJust work hard and become friends with your teachers, they want to help you. If engineering doesn't work out I know a dozen of people who changed their majors sophomore year and are still graduating on time(from taking summer school). \n\nAlso, take advantage of what Tcu provides you. Most people I know have gone through all 4 years not knowing all the awesome services TCU provides. They have free writing tutors, career advisors, speakers, etc. that some people don't even know about. Your paying a lot of money to go here, take advantage of it and good luck ",

They expect a lot out of you, but you learn so much. All of the professors are amazingly smart, and trust me when I say that compared to most other schools, they are insanely accessible. They will all help you as much as they can whenever you need it. The travel programs are great, and after doing MUN under Dr. Cox for four years, I can honestly say that it was the greatest experience of my life. Plus, he's president of the national organization, so we watched him shake Ban Ki-Moon's hand which is pretty freaking cool. \n\nI didn't personally like a few, but it wasn't because they didn't know their subjects inside and out. They were all incredible and many are considered national experts on many topics. My roommate for 3 years was a transfer, although a business student, and said coming to TCU was the best decision he's ever made. Looking back on my four years at TCU in the Poli as I department, I would never want to be anywhere else.

There's goobers in every chapter, mine was no exception, and SigNu has their full share just because they're still feeling out an identity, but they're a solid group. Hope that helps -- one piece of advice I have is that you shouldn't seek out a chapter just solely because you're a legacy, but instead you should just find the one that you fit best with.

Informal bids are important, and you can just contact the rush chair for a few fraternities let them know you are interested/a legacy and ask if they have any summer events planned in the DFW area. \n\n2. Legacy gets your foot in the door. You can mess it up at that point or cement your place in the pledge class.\n\n3. Yes there are stereotypes. They tend to be loosely based in fact. I graduated in 2015, but generally the stereotypes were Lambda Chi were high school athletes, Phi Kapps were meatheads, Sigma Chis were stoners, Phi Delts were hicks, SAEs were cokeheads. Some members fit the stereotypes perfectly, others not at all, most fell somewhere in the middle. Greekrank offers some very limited, very biased insight into how certain chapters are thought of on campus. \n\n4. Yes, the Sigma Nu chapter is new, may still be colony. I don't know cause I graduated before they showed up I think. Colonies tend to focus on good grades and good guys, at the expense of things kids really care about (for the most part) which are parties, girls, and substances to enjoy the first two. Depends on where your priorities are. ",

Tiers are also a rough approximation of the fraternity generally, plenty of goobers and good guys in each. Any rankings will be disputed by someone somewhere.

Your perception of the \"tiers\" is going to depend largely on who you hangout with on campus. Join the group that you fit into the best, and have a great time with those guys. Each fraternity has great guys and there are benefits and drawbacks to each organization. I highly highly encourage you to rush as many fraternities as possible to get a feel for where you belong.\n\n Informal rush happens, but it will still be happening when you get to campus (Usually 1 or 2 more weeks left) and some fraternities give lots of bids over summer, others only give a handful.\n\nFeel free to PM me with any more questions, current Senior here.",
