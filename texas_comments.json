        "body": "> So, does this mean that having past 9 yrs, UT does not longer hold the record about me??\n\nThat's not what it means.\n\nLooking over things, it appears that there will be two important components to factor in: (1) which sanction you received, if any, and (2) the distinction between your transcript and your disciplinary record.\n\nFor your transcript, [\u00a7 9-402](https://catalog.utexas.edu/general-information/appendices/appendix-c/educational-records/#subchapter9400.officialtranscripts) contains what information would be included on a transcript. Notably, that includes:\n\n* for undergraduate students, a symbol showing scholastic probation or scholastic dismissal, if any, during the period of probation or dismissal; for graduate students, a symbol showing scholastic dismissal;\n* notation of disciplinary suspension or disciplinary expulsion, or ineligible to enroll due to reasons other than academic or financial, if applicable.\n\nLooking at [\u00a7 9-301](https://catalog.utexas.edu/general-information/appendices/appendix-c/educational-records/#subchapter9300.disciplinaryrecords) it would seem (to me) that if you received a suspension (assuming that all of the conditions of the sanction were met), you may be within your rights to \"request for the removal of the transcript notation of suspension.\"\n\nI'm going to assume that the other sanctions (\"expulsion, denial or revocation of a degree, dismissal from an academic program, withdrawal of a diploma, or permanent bar from admission or enrollment\") do not apply in your case.\n\nSeparate from the transcript is a disciplinary record. The disciplinary record will reflect the nature of the charge, the sanction assessed, and any other pertinent information. That's the one that \"will be maintained for at least seven years.\" As an employee of the university, I can tell you that it's not safe to assume that \"at least seven years\" means that it gets automatically expunged after seven years. It's more like \"we guarantee that we'll hold on to it for seven years but will get rid of it whenever we feel like it at some point thereafter.\" I don't interface with disciplinary records, but I know that we definitely maintain decades of student records (which is why you can still request a transcript).\n\nAs with many things at the university, it's complicated. You'll note that there's a lot of hedging in my various comments (\"in general,\" \"can appear,\" \"it shouldn't be,\" \"it appears,\" \"you may be,\" and so forth). Under \u00a7 9-301(b) you have the right to request a copy of your own disciplinary record so you could always use that avenue to check and see if it's still on file. You may also, as another commenter noted, request a copy of your transcript (it will cost some money) so that you can review what is actually on it.\n\nI know that this isn't a precise answer to your question, but as I'm not involved in disciplinary records I really don't know how, exactly, the university handles these records. Hopefully, the information I was able to provide is at least somewhat helpful.",

You basically get spoon-fed instructions for the semester project and have an insane amount of resources outside of the weekly videos posted.\n\nDr. Bradbury for Personality was also a highlight for me last semester. She is wicked smart and makes the material endlessly interesting. The online format is very straightforward (weekly quizzes + 2 video assignments and a self-input participation grade). I know some people dislike her for her critique of \"male and heteronormative\" psychological theories but overall I think she's a genuinely great professor who cares a lot about her students being successful",

        "body": "Going from Dr. F's class to Dr. Caudill's will definitely be a transition because the trio's grading structure is far less lenient - it just means that you need to immediately address any gaps in your understanding as soon as you find them and continue to test yourself from start to end - that's the only way to avoid making the end of the semester hellish studying for the final. You're going to have probably 5-6 lectures in between each exam if it's still 4 exams, and those pretty much determine your grade. It's on you to study regularly between them as opposed to a class where you'd have weekly quizzes or homework that's more than 5% of your grade. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSince the grading structure doesn't really account for life happening on test days, I'd highly recommend getting ahead on material whenever you have a chance so that you have some leeway in case you get sick or something during the semester. The reason people say Caudill is horrible is usually the same reason they say other trio profs are terrible: the class is really intense, especially if you are seeing the material for the first time. Their exams are not straightforward and require you do a lot of practice.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think Dr. Bordas's class is a good balance between these two because you come out with a thorough understanding and there isn't as much pressure since the weekly quizzes and homework are worth much more of your grade, plus for chem2 the final is the ACS and the questions are reaalllly straightforward, you just gotta start studying a month before because it also includes chem1 material. Her class has the most generous grading structure for CH302 to my knowledge, unless Fakhreddine changed something.",

The people in this LLC are so amazing and it practically became my home away from home. There was never a night where I felt alone, because I could walk out and talk with someone in the study rooms. It\u2019s such a welcoming environment (expect surprise birthdays parties) because everyone is first-gen. \n\nTo be honest, you probably won\u2019t find the same resources anywhere on campus. There\u2019s other programs that pair other first-gen students, but the LLC let\u2019s you live with other first-gen students. Kayleigh is the coordinator for the program and she\u2019s AMAZING! Like she\u2019s the reason for the LLC being such an amazing place for other first-gen students. She\u2019ll be there for you and root for you every step of your college career. On top of that, you\u2019re placed with a Peer Leader (a past First-Gen LLC student) to help guide you through your first year.\n\nI\u2019d rate the LLC a 10/10 and would 100% do it again. The LLC is the place where everyone suffers together as first-gen students. \n\nThere\u2019s really nothing bad I can say about the LLC. The only bad thing that ever happened was never knowing who miss Denise was talking on the phone with 24/7.  It\u2019s a 14th floor inside joke. 14th floor is like the floor that never sleeps. It\u2019s a party every day. \n\nIt\u2019s up to you if you want to be a part of the LLC, but it really changed my first-gen experience. \n\nAs I said, a little biased.",

Avoid excuses to go do major grocery shopping or doing an entire month of laundry. \n\nGet at least 10 minutes of sunshine in the morning and then again in the evening. \n\nStay hydrated- preferably water! \n\nDelete time wasting apps from your phone and get a friend to change your social media passwords.

How much natural light affected my mood (coming from a place that was much less sunny), and\n4. Get a credit card with cash back rewards. At least back then, they didn't openly advertise that they had those. That's 3 years of cash back I missed out on.\n\nI've channeled a lot of the resulting frustration into the [r/UTAustin FAQ](/r/UTAustin/wiki/faq), the [r/UTAdmissions wiki](/r/UTAdmissions/wiki), and the [New Student FAQ](/r/UTAdmissions/wiki/accepted) so that other folks have access to the information that I didn't.\n\nThere were a few other things, but they're less of an issue now. For example, I was happy that I already knew how to read and navigate by map.

It can get pretty hands on, rather than a theory factory that is so often dreaded. Most importantly, it is a powerful ticket to networking. A professor can go a long way in helping you find an internship or give you great insight on what fields are worth getting into. Building marketable experience is also a major plus; research experience counts for something, even for industry that may be unrelated. I can go on and on, and I haven\u2019t even mentioned grad school, but I think my point is clear. \n\n Explore different labs, and just email. The willingness alone is a great impression to make, even if you feel lacking in experience. Talking to profs after class and getting good grades in their courses is also a great way to get into it.\n\n\nPerhaps OP already graduated and is just curious, or maybe they\u2019re looking for advice.

Still, I'll just say $1,200 a year for simplicity's sake.\n\nAdding all of his up we get around $9,288 for the whole year. The cheapest dorms will cost you is around $13k the last time I checked, so that's roughly $4k saved. Keep in mind, the apartment estimate includes the extra 3 months that you usually get on a lease as opposed to the dorms (12 month leases for apartments, 9 months for dorms) so in reality you're saving a lot more.\n\nSorry if this came off as condescending or if this reply seems a bit extra, but I figured it might be helpful to someone browsing this thread looking to clear anything up.",

Additionally, you are in a FIG with the other individuals in WINS, so not everyone may be your major. As far as FRI, YES YOU SHOULD ACCEPT!! You will have the opportunity to tour labs/see posters/talk to current students in the Fall and FRI has CS labs. This is a great way to see if you are interested in research and is a great thing to add to your resume to set you apart from others. Take a look on the FRI website to see what labs interest you.

On your transcript, your classes will have a W, but if you previously Q dropped a course, that will stay a Q. You do not need to reapply after you withdraw IF you come back the next long semester. What does this mean? I withdrew last fall, spend it at home getting better, then I came back in the spring. If you have a gap between semesters, like if I didn\u2019t come back and instead went back this upcoming fall, yes you need to reapply.\n\nHowever! I was told by my advisor that the readmission process is pretty simple. You already got in once so they know you\u2019re smart. They want to know you\u2019re getting better. Talking to your advisors and D&A is the best course.\n\nUT in my own experience is very accommodating and nice when these things happen, physical or mental. Make sure you have your medical records, and take it easy this summer! The hardest part is the paperwork right now, just try to get it in as soon as possible, you\u2019ll be ok!\n\nSending good vibes your way",

I know it feels like the worlds ending right now, but know that everything is going to be fine and you\u2019re going to get over this bump. The other comment really got all the main points, but yeah you will not receive credit for the semester and your courses will be considered W drops (these are different than you 6 allotted Q drops). The main impact that might affect you is if you meet satisfactory academic progress (SAP) because your courses will be counted as \u201cattempted\u201d but not completed. In the case withdrawing affects your SAP, like it did mine when I medically withdrew my sophomore year, it might affect your security with financial aid (if you get anything from FAFSA). If financial aid is a concern, you can submit an SAP appeal and they\u2019ll be understanding and see that you\u2019re below SAP because of medically withdrawing, so you should almost certainly get your appeal approved. You\u2019ll be able to come back to UT and all will be well! Wishing you the best of luck \ud83d\udc9b feel free to reach out if you have any questions! \n\nAlso, if you don\u2019t already, look into D&A accommodations! They\u2019re genuinely life savers with classes and managing coursework (or even having course load reductions so you can drop classes without impacting your Q drops).",

I always feel safe on campus, but around the city it depends on where you are going and what hour of the day. Football games are so fun and tons of people go, and so are basketball games. Definitely look into student organizations before you get here so you can find some to join, because that is probably how you will be able to make friends. If you don't put yourself out there and join activities you will probably feel isolated. The school can really be as small/big/good/bad/party/studious as you make it, which is what is great about UT! Austin is also a really cool place to live and there is a ton of fun stuff to do in the city.

In terms of nature I feel like Austin or Texas in general can't compare to New Zealand's scenery haha. For math classes, I would say it depends on your professor so I would look at reviews.

        "body": "Something else you should consider is whether you _should_ go to UT at this time. \n\nCollege is expensive, even at UT. Sure, it's a state school, but with tuition deregulation and cost of living in Austin, an education at UT is a huge investment. It's even worse if you spend a huge pile of money (i.e., debt that cannot be dismissed via bankruptcy, by the way) only to find out you don't have your shit together when you flunk out, getting no return on that investment.\n\nThe first question you should think _seriously_ about is what everyone is asking -- how on EARTH did you make such a low grade? Tough love, sorry man, but honestly, what the fuck? Is there some very severe extenuating situation that caused it? And if so, will it be resolved in 4 months?\n\nIf it's just a lack of work ethic, senioritis gone way too far, etc, I'd say it's very unlikely you'll get a magical burst of motivation and work ethic when you show up to UT and start burning 3-5 dollars per hour just to be in college.\n\nI knew a lot of really smart kids in high school who came to UT and were gone within 2 years. Some people just do not have the discipline to make it, they'd get too into partying, substance abuse, etc., or just plain never learned how to study because high school was easy enough for them to get by without those skills. No idea what happened to any of them but it's safe to say their lives did not turn out the way they had planned. This even happened to our salutatorian, he flunked out the first year and went to ACC \"to get the basics out of the way\" but he never came back. I kept seeing him at parties, though. After another year he moved back to our hometown and that's all she wrote.\n\nAll I'm saying is that sometimes reaching for something and missing is worse than taking the long way around, both financially and for your self confidence and odds of success in the long run.\n\nGood luck. I know you may think you won the lottery by getting into UT CS despite what you have done, but you may reflect on it as a curse of sorts, one day.",

I totally understand your senioritis, I basically did the same thing my senior year. But my highschool didn\u2019t record percentages into my transcript, it only recorded letter grades. And each letter grade was assigned a number of points(10 for A+, 9 for A, and so on) and the number associated with each letter grade from each marking period would be added up and averaged out, and that would be your final grade. \n\nSo if that\u2019s confusing, if you have two A-s and two As across four marking periods, that would be 8 + 8 + 9+ 9, divide that by 4 you get 8.5 which rounds up to 9 which is an A\n\nSo in my highschool a 0-64 was all an F, which was a 0 in terms of those points. So I did ok ish my other marking periods and just got all Fs my last marking period, including a 4 in English, and no one ever knew because only my final grades were sent\n\nCheck if your hs does something like that",

Tune it out.\n\nTry to come up with some passion professions that could lead to each of those passions of yours\u2026 I\u2019m sure there is some LGBT style sports publication out there. Email some of the people that work there and ask to schedule a call because you\u2019re interested in their work. Lucky for you with writing you can easily note a work of theirs that you liked and wanted to ask questions about. You can worry about the details after someone actually says yes. Based on your background and interests I could see you doing freelance work but we all know freelance isn\u2019t for everyone and can be difficult with no work history beforehand. It\u2019s probably very likely you end up doing a Master\u2019s program somewhere and work some networking during that program. \n\nIn addition, and this is our unfortunate reality, find some jobs you could realistically find yourself doing as well. You\u2019ll likely be in something entry-level, that\u2019s cool and expected. Schedule calls with people who are and aren\u2019t entry-level, although the emails of people who are entry-level are a little harder to find. Discuss the positives and negatives of their job and their path to it as well. Differentiate yourself. You\u2019ll also have to mass apply, this sucks too but is part of the process. Get a friend to look over your resume and a typical cover letter.\n\nThis is a tough part of life and it sucks if you don\u2019t have anything lined up. It\u2019s also hard to be self-directed in pursuit of something that only you really know what you want.

Sure it's UT owned and they technically have dorm-esque restrictions, but things such as alcohol, visitors etc are not really enforced... at all. Gym, pool, decent balconies, parking attached to the building (though it's kind of expensive compared to other UT parking). \n\nThe price is fantastic and maintenance is extremely fast. Our garbage disposal broke once on a Friday at 3:45pm -- maintenance request submitted at 3:50, and they showed up at 4:20 to fix it and were done in less than five minutes. Location is good, view is fine (I personally don't care about the view at all, but if that is a deal breaker for you then you can get a view if you get lucky choosing a room).\n\nIf you have any more questions let me know",

ECE302 and ECE306 are pretty difficult. 302 is standardized, but 306 isn't, and its difficulty depends on your prof (this fall, only Telang and Patt are teaching IIRC. Patt is much harder but more rewarding imo)\n\nIf you want to pass/get around a B, I wouldn't stress too much about the courses and just worry about learning the material and feeling solid on it.

Neither of us has any hard evidence on this point but do you see where my assumption is coming from? If I'm a student from an upper middle class family with a parent who works at Apple either as an engineer or in a business role, I will have an advantage at getting an internship with Apple. Even indirect connections to businesses are more likely for well off students, parents have a friend or former coworker working at the business. Your point about a student with a doctor and an rn for parents goes along this line. Students coming from money will have more connections to people with money and working in these high earning areas.\n\n\nMaybe the sticking point is that I used the term affluent. Maybe not the best word to describe it but most of the student body at UT come from families making over 6 figures, which is in stark contrast to my experience being a working student on the Pell grant.

        "body": "when I applied as a cap student, then again for a successful internal transfer into moody rtf, I never used a story or an anecdote in my personal statements. I just stated the situation I was in (such as background, things I'm passionate about, what I have been doing in the time being, etc), my goals for college and my career post graduation, and why I needed UT specifically to help me reach those goals. it was very straightforward and to the point because I never felt like one dramatic event would make me a viable student for UT plus whenever I wrote anecdotal essays like that they were cringe worthy at best. I think for these internal/external applications it is more for UT to know why you want to pursue a major, what you plan to do with it, and how you will grow as a student at UT, so I felt like one (or two) anecdotes wouldn't be able to express that the same way than if I just directly told them explicitly.\n\nYou didn't ask but for my additional information section, I talked about my time at UT specifically in terms of what classes I have taken and how they have helped me in preparing for the transfer. I also talked about how it would support me in my professional career and why being in that specific major is the only choice for success (like an ultimatum lol). \n\nHonestly I feel like I only got in bc I did well in the classes they offered me while I was a non major, but even during my application as a hs senior I used very short anecdotes to show how I've grown as a person.",

I don't know where you're transferring from, but my experience of transferring from COLA undeclared to MechE was quite a journey. During freshman orientation, I was told by my advisor that I made a huge mistake of choosing to attend UT as undeclared rather attending, say, A&M as a MechE. However, being the stubborn person I am, I boldy disagreed. I knew that admissions made a mistake, and I belonged where I said I belonged. On top of not having a home where I could interact with other MechEs of my class, I did have to make some sacrifices, such as taking both engineering physics courses that I already had credit for, simply because I didn't have enough courses to take. I took that as an opportunity to refresh fundamental engineering concepts. Rejection also motivated me to work harder and prove my doubters wrong (sounds like a movie script, I know). Fast forward almost two years and I'm an honors MechE student. I know what you went through, and I know exactly how you're feeling right now. Throw that uncertainty out the window and wholeheartedly believe those 500 words you put together as your statement of purpose. After all, you really meant it. In the end, it comes down to this\u2014you prove 'em wrong or you prove 'em wrong. I hope you get to prove 'em wrong instead of having to prove 'em wrong. But really, you got this.

        "body": "> are there people on here who also came from small schools/are out of state students?\n\nAbsolutely. I, for one, was an OOS student at UT Austin. That's part of why I put together [FAQ: What do I need to know as an out-of-state applicant?](/r/UTAdmissions/wiki/outofstate) on the [r/UTAdmissions wiki](/r/UTAdmissions/wiki). I did, however, go to a high school with 700+ people in my graduating class whereas my roommate during orientation was from a town of under 3000 people total.\n\n> i know the undergrad population is huge -- are class sizes overwhelming? \n\nYour intro courses will typically be pretty large. Those are often broken up into lectures and discussion sections. Lectures can easily have over a hundred students in them, but discussion section are typically one or two dozen. As you begin to take more specialized courses the class size will get smaller. It's hard to remember, but I believe my smallest class size might have been a dozen people?\n\n> is it easy to get close with professors and get opportunities as an undergrad? \n\nThis will really depend on a number of factors. Ultimately, though, if you put in the work (i.e., going to office hours) then yes, you can absolutely establish a working relationship with the instructor and/or TA. Obviously, this will be easier with smaller departments, as you get into more specialized major-area courses, etc. It will also depend on the individual instructor, as well. I had instructors who knew me well enough that they were excited to meet my parents at the department's post-commencement get-together. I've also had instructors who I wouldn't want to get to know.\n\n> also, what should i expect in regards to party culture? i know greek life is a big thing, which i am not a huge fan of, but i'm still interested in partying and having a good time during college -- is the bar/house party scene decent?\n\nIt's entirely what you make of it. Those opportunities absolutely exist but they are not in any way a prerequisite for a meaningful college experience. I am not, however, in a position to comment on how good the bar/house party scene is.\n\nWhile you're here, you might also be interested in the [r/UTAdmissions wiki](/r/UTAdmissions/wiki/index) where we answer many of the questions posed by prospective students.",

I ended up going to large school in the northeast (~38k students). It was a big change. Classes were massive and it felt like I was a sole person in a sea of many. Though being in a large school gave me many options to try different things. Also my major was fairly small so while the first 2 years had massive classes my last 2 had much smaller ones (100 vs 500 students) and being science based the labs were much smaller (20ish). It was a great mix, but at the same time I had to learn to take responsibility the hard way. Before going to a proper university I got my AS from a local CC.  Smaller universities have the benefits of teachers getting to know you and keep you accountable while larger ones you need to keep yourself accountable.  It\u2019s a big shift. \n\nNow, like I said originally the biggest difference lies between being in Texas vs the NE. The culture is completely different between the two and it\u2019s highly reflective in the teaching and approach to students.  In my undergrad it was almost impossible to build a relationship with your professors and finding volunteer opportunities were almost impossible.  I built one relationship with a professor and that was out of dumb luck under odd circumstances. For volunteering, I asked dozens and got rejected by dozens.  Most professors won\u2019t give you a single look, no matter how impressive you may be.  Again, I got lucky and volunteered at a medical school because of a friend referral.  The focus is on graduate students only, not undergrads.  That was the same for the university I did my MS at. \n\nNow UT is completely different.  It\u2019s Texas and it\u2019s a lot more welcoming.  I came here for my doctorate work and had more then my fair share of teaching time.  I\u2019ve even audited a few under grad classes.  Professors here are much more welcoming to undergrads.  Maybe it\u2019s because it\u2019s more undergrad focus, or maybe it\u2019s just Texas. Regardless, if you show interest in a professors work, you can build a relationship with them. If you want to actually partake in research, most professors are very open to it. I\u2019ve trained more undergrads then I can remember at this point. \n\nOverall, coming here from the northeast was a bit of a culture shock at first.  But it\u2019s been a great change.",

You\u2019ll definitely look back fondly on your college days, mostly cause we didn\u2019t appreciate \u2018em as much while we were in \u2018em. That goes for most things in life. But that doesn\u2019t mean your future sucks. All depends on what you want in life, what you do for a living, your mindset going into it, the work you put in & the lucky breaks you catch, etc. And those things will change as you age and become wiser as well. Leaning on friends or fam who are also going through it or have gone through it helps. If/when you get a job, you\u2019ll meet new people and will prob make a couple friends that way too. You\u2019ll be alright. \n\nLife\u2019s full of ups and downs. It\u2019s a rollercoaster. It\u2019s never the same for too long and change is the only constant. We\u2019re all eating a shit-sandwich out here and making the best of it. You will too. The good news is, no matter how bad it ever gets, tomorrow\u2019s always a new day. Used to think that expression was corny as hell when I was younger, but in my mid-30\u2019s, I realize it\u2019s very true. Life can always get better. And it usually does. Just remember, everyone\u2019s fighting a battle that you don\u2019t see. Many times multiple. All of us. So we\u2019re all in this thing together. Plus, you never know when you might meet someone along the way that changes your life for the better. Best of luck dude. Onward and upward. \ud83e\udd18\ud83c\udffc",

I had an absolute blast in college and my mid to late twenties were even more fun while I settled into my career and watched my friends take the next step with grad, law, med school etc. The next phase was filled full of establishment of relationships, housing, career, etc. There were a few weddings sprinkled in there but we still saw our college friends, many of them will be around for lifetime. Our 30s were the best and now you really start thinking about family. Also, they are the most fun. You now have money to anything you want and you can do it recklessly. Travel the world, keep close people close and most of us found love. We partied differently now at a different scale. I just finished doing a major bender at a friends cabin with a bunch of people. I now have a newborn son and couldn\u2019t be happier. I\u2019m a season ticket holder and I\u2019ll never grow up.\n\nRemember, college is only 3-5 years of your entire life for most people. The future is bright, and it won\u2019t be the most fun you\u2019ve ever had. Cheers to your last exam, now get out there and show the world and yourself exactly what you\u2019re made of.

I signed up to be a room monitor for a couple of Capstone presentations at school yesterday and I had a similar (not empty) feeling as well. I was watching the 2nd years present (before they graduate in about two weeks) and got this odd feeling that woah, in a year, I will be in their shoes, graduating with people I have known for two years and going off on a new direction with or without the people who I have hung out with. \n\nI normally get these feelings but this time it hit different, maybe because I myself will be interning in a completely new city and going with only a handful of people from my program (not in the same company even, just same area). What happens next? Will I miss out on memories being made back at home? Maybe I should have asked that person out before leaving? There are always a million different things running through our heads as we head to the final words of a chapter.\n\nI think u/tyleratx had a point when talking about goals; when you get to the \"end\", what is the \"endgame\"? It is always a good thing to create new chapters and possibilities when you have completed one set. Once you approach the end of a stage, you may feel the need to dwell on the memories, both good and bad, the regrets and no-regrets, and everything in between.\n\nIt may seem like an abyss, but in a way, it is your abyss. What happens when you boot up Minecraft in a new world? You enter a completely new environment, full of rich opportunities (and mistakes) to be made. In a way, that is life; a series of stages that (unlike a video game) has no ending - you are free to make your own next steps.\n\nSo 1st of all - CONGRATS ON YOUR DEGREE! You seem to have the next steps already falling into place which is always a good sign. Only thing I have to say really is good luck, take some time to bask in the victory, and then strap on your life jacket and jump back into the sea called life.\n\nCheers! \ud83c\udf77",

Not to scare you or anything but I was able to look at the syllabus he had from last semester (I doubt the fall 2022 and spring 2023 syllabi look that different aside from due dates). Based on the percentages, and if I did my math right, if you make a 50/50 on E4 you\u2019ll end up with a grade of about 85.2. Unfortunately it states that if there is a class curve it will be applied after the final exam if necessary. So hopefully your classmates suck at Diff Eq, so you can hopefully get closer to that A you want. Double check in the event the grade distribution is different. But know that a B is still a great grade, it can be a tough class, and getting a B is impressive for Diff Eq. So try to not stress too much about the final grade. A B will not ruin your academic career, but I get it\u2019s still stressful. Best of luck to you!",

        "body": "I graduated with Bio with Computational concentration in '22. Overall it is a good major to be in especially if you are interested in statistics/data analysis side of biology. I took Dr. Wylie class and he was very helpful about giving advice and mentorship. Something he mentioned to me was a PhD is probably the best for the field (though my current co-workers says a Master's isn't bad either). Dr. Woodward is also great with his stats class (Biostatistics  and elements of data science). Elements of Data science used to be a bioinformatics class but transformed into a upper division computational stats class.\n\n\nThere are a lot of opportunities on campus if you look for it. There aren't a lot of comp bio majors and a good portion of them usually take the FRI lab. I didn't since I was interested in wet lab stuff early in my college career. \n\nThe comp bio related classes aren't bad. I think they help build a solid statistics background and computer science (mostly R, but python is helpful). I wished there were higher end classes available to undergrads like machine learning as the industry is slowly moving in that direction.\n\nIf I were to redo my time at UT, I would have tried harder to get an internship during my time. I lost my opportunity the spring COVID hit. There are a lot of opportunities outside of Austin. Boston and or California are places where there are a lot of opportunities. The Broad Insititite has a pretty good internship program from hearing from my co-workers. I moved to Boston when I graduated.\n\nI hope that this info helps and feel free to DM me if you have any questions",

You just have to have initiative to email incessantly and arrange yourself the opportunity by meeting with the principal investigator of your choice (w/ email plucked off of the UT faculty directory for either institution). UT really does have world class resources\u2014it\u2019s just up to the individual student to access them (and a VAST majority of students don\u2019t access them to their fullest potential!)\n\nI did bioinformatics research for 2.5 years starting with immunology/oncology and then going into COVID stuff. Burnt out on research as I realized I wanted to just do MD and not MD/PhD but I certainly could have kept going. Was able to get deeply involved enough to coauthor a paper based on several bioinformatics analyses + figures I finished during first semester of my sophomore year. The research educator for Big Data in Biology was also a coauthor on my paper/collaborator for my lab + I learned the analysis I did from her :)\n\nThere are several PIs who I know need bioinformatics people + there\u2019s a good demand for us, so depending on your engagement and adaptability, expect to be a hot commodity haha\u2026Kowalski, Yi, probably Ehrlich, probably Melamed, and probably Wylie (if he runs a lab. I know he did biology-applied machine learning research stuff during COVID at least) are examples of labs that might be of interest to you. I\u2019m sure there are also plant people if you don\u2019t have an interest in immunology/cancer/neurology.\n\nAnd my lab had collaborators at Vanderbilt/etc. so really if you just get into any lab you should be totally fine and can do internships in a number of locations.\n\nOne caveat is I\u2019ve heard Austin doesn\u2019t have much in the way of life sciences industry (that being more the domain of Boston + Harvard/MIT). That being said, my lab worked pretty closely with Akoya Biosciences for a spatial single cell study and EuroFins and other companies have blown up my inbox with recruiting emails in past years. So yeah, you\u2019d probably be set here if you keep your head on the swivel and apply yourself",

Sorry I can\u2019t help much with that.\n\nI do have one friend from high school at UCSD for comp. biology who, by the look of his LinkedIn, has yet to land an internship and job for after his UCSD graduation? But maybe he\u2019s not the type to post (though it looks like his LinkedIn is oriented toward finding an internship/job) or maybe it\u2019s a him problem re: initiative, social skills, etc.\n\nAnd I have one friend whose parents went to CMU for compsci and they make bank and are very happy people. Kinda useless information to ya, sorry.\n\nUltimately, where you go for college (given your options are UT vs UCSD vs CMU) is less of a determining factor of your success than what you do once you\u2019re in college. UT\u2019s comp bio *program* is pretty new/barebones\u2014while we are known for CS, the comp bio program I feel doesn\u2019t borrow the prestige/clout of that too heavily at all. If CMU and UCSD have better graduate programs for computational biology AND they have track records of placing into internships, I think you would probably have a slightly easier time succeeding there. That being said, if you\u2019re resolutely determined to succeed *period*, you can do it anywhere you listed (and the decision then comes down to tuition / extending your savings as far into grad school as you can provided that\u2019s what you want to do).",

You see, clubs like PSC love being hazy on this distinction on who is a \"settler.\" They can claim that they are against the \"occupation\" (they never define what they mean by this term) when the vast majority of them would want all Jews out of Israel, or at best a tiny minority in a majority Arab state. It's a great ploy used by the BDS movement, and allows them to coerce your average well-meaning westerner. Because I am willing to bet money that if there was a survey taken in private at a PSC meeting, at minimum 85-90% of them would consider all Jews in the Levant settlers who according to them should all go back to Poland  or some other eastern European country (very standard antizionist argument), despite Jews from Arab countries making up 44.9% of the Arab population.\n\nBut if you mean Jews living in West Bank/Judea and Samaria? Any land controlled by Israel was won during the defensive 67' war, when Egypt started mobilizing forces in the Sinai Peninsula and Gamel Nasser declared war on Israel. Any territories that Israel holds on to now are for religious/historical reasons and also because Israel does not want to hand over all of the territory they conquered as some kind of a consolation prize, like they did with the Gaza strip and the Sinai Peninsula. It's also to prevents events like [Hebron Massacre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1929_Hebron_massacre) from happening again (Hebron in in the West Bank). Btw, the Gaza strip is a great example of why unilaterally exiting an area is a terrible idea for Israel: it turns into a Hamas fighter breeding ground.\n\nAnd if you're asking if I support so called \"resistance\" against people in the West Bank, the answer is no. I do not support infants being decapitated while they sleep because Franz Fanon or some decolonialist writer that PSC likes said it was a-ok: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011\\_Itamar\\_attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_Itamar_attack)\n\nedit: grammar",

If there is anything to be described as the colonialist, it is the desire of the Baathists to create a unified Arab States, or the SSNP to create a Greater Syria, with the SSNP directly borrowing from Nazi symbolism or the Baathists attempting to develop a ummah across the entire Middle East. If there is anything that should be considered colonialist, it should be that, along with the reason why Arabs are in Palestine in the first place (all thanks to the 7th century Islamic conquests). If there is anything that is to be considered colonialism, it would be that, but unfortunately your average PSC member or left-leaning Middle East Studies professor at UT would not agree, given that their perspective is that any sort of colonialism that is done by individuals that aren't from the European subcontinent doesn't count. But I digress.\n\n  \nGreat Britain did not \"create\" a nation in the Middle East. The Jews living in the land fought against the British to have their national homeland realized. The only reason that they held on to the land in the first place was because it was taken from the Ottomans at the end of World War 1.  As of 1948 there were 600,000 Jews (who bought the land legally) and 1,200,000 Arabs vying for control of the country, when the UN proposed the partition of Palestine into two independent states plus UN-controlled Jerusalem. The Jews reluctantly accepted the UN compromise. The Arabs rejected the UN compromise outright and chose instead to fight a civil war for exclusive control. The \"colonialism\" that is said to result in instability should be seen as a lesson in the inability to compromise supporting \"resistance\" by all means necessary, as your average Palestinian activist argues for. If one want a solution to the endless war, they should not goad on people blowing up [pizza parlors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sbarro_restaurant_suicide_bombing) and massacring [Olympic athletes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munich_massacre).",

Anyone at any Big 10 school could make insightful comparisons between Big 10 schools even between different majors and schools lol.\n\nI'm from the Midwest and went to UT for grad school.  Way back when I was deciding on an undergrad institution I wanted help from my older brothers friends who were at a lot of the schools I applied to. I'd ask hey how do you like Wisconsin Madison? Do you think it's better than Michigan? They always had solid answers like \"I love Madison blah blah, Michigan is such a small college town you're really stuck in a bubble. Even Champaign-Urbana has more stuff to do\". When I asked the Michigan bro the same question he said \"Michigan is obviously a better school, but the opportunities you'll find at a state capital like Madison are way better than what you'll find locally here, and there's just more stuff to do there. If you want to bail out of pre-med and go into biotech Wisconsin is way better for that, because there's actually an industry for it there.\" Could I have surmised this information on my own, through other sources? Yes. Was it still helpful to hear it from the horses mouth? Yes.\n\nY'all were single minded on UT (which is fine!) and it shows. This is a hard life changing decision to make and people are trying to get as much info as they can! /Rant\n\nEdit: Never got this closed minded vibe during the 6 years I was at UT wow - and thank you to whoever reported me to reddit as suicidal/mentally unstable lol.\n\nOne reply asked why would they care about any other school than the one they're at (UT). Because a world exists outside of UT when you're on the job market - employers are going to be comparing applicants from different schools and *they* care. Knowing how UT might not stack up against your competitors (or is better than them) gives you an opportunity to address potential shortcomings early on or capitalize on the things that made your background better than others because you went to UT.",

I have a degree in microbiology from UT Austin - which I wouldn't trade that experience for the world - but compared to other state flagships it's just not competitive, even UT Galveston has a better microbiology program lol. People hiring for micro jobs know this - they're not hiring on general university overall reputation - so I have to front load with other work experience because my degree from UT Austin doesn't mean as much to micro employers than say if it was from any number of other state schools like UCSD, UW, WM, let alone a couple other UT system schools, let alone the private elite schools. If your degree is already ranked in the top 10 or whatever you're good to go, but otherwise it's not a good idea to think just because your degree is from UT that your education won't be compared against someone else's. I know I'm saying this on the UT sub and I'm already downvoted to hell but it is what it is.",

Also my brother and his friends aren't hypotheticals lol but go off - the askers are trying to find people like then. If you're not then no need to answer just move on. \n\n> It\u2019s a stupid and repetitive question to ask to people who already go to UT and don\u2019t understand the persons full comprehensive circumstances that can influence a decision like this.\n\nHow? People can end up at UT and be like I hate it for xyz. It's not stupid to ask just because they're already here? They could regret their decision lol. And just because someone is already here doesn't mean they're here for reason OP would be asking about, and if you're not the person who has the specific insight then don't answer. They can interpret whatever info they get within the context of what matters to them, there doesn't have to be 100% life story sharing for something to be useful to someone.  \n\n> you\u2019re just bitter that you got 40 downvotes for getting wound up calling people in the sub closed minded in response to a damn meme post.\n\nOuch lol. If I cared *at all* about the downvotes I would have deleted my reply looong ago. I sympathize with people trying to gather as much info as possible before they make a big decision - if people on here can't help them then they don't need to answer them. Pretty simple. Y'all got so heated by me saying some people actually *do* know things about other schools, like whoa the horror! \n\n**However**, I did not see this as a meme post(!) which helps explain the reaction *a lot*. Wish someone told me that sooner, I have ADHD and I'm on the spectrum so I miss that stuff sometimes.

CNS is super strict on some of the core classes they require for that college like an example is that the stats that I took for Mccombs was a lot more math and coding focuses than CNS and they still wanted me to retake the stats course for CNS. Mccombs also has more core classes than CNS so that is going to be an obstacle to finish on time. I\u2019m probably going to drop my double because I want to graduate on time",

The most obvious example being the Mongols invasion and oppresion of Asian, Arab, and White populations. Even in the 20th century you see the Japanese occupation of Korea, the ethnic destruction of China during WW2, Pol Pot's oppression of his fellow Cambodians. That is the same in Africa as you saw how Africans sold each other to European slave traders, the Rwandan genocide of the Tutsi, and the Garissa massacre in Kenya against ethnic Somali's.

It is true that several hundred thousand Chinese citizens were executed and several million more sent to labor camps during Mao's Cultural Revolution, and they deserved it.  Communist theory functions on the principle that those who exploit lower classes for profit are unethical and that such exploitation should be illegal.  Under Mao, it was.  Those who perpetrated minor offenses (landlords, upper class businesspeople, property speculators) were sent to the work camps.  The politicians and industrialists in power before Mao that didn't escape to Taiwan with Chiang Kai-shek were executed.  Sounds fair to me.  We have forced labor camps and capital punishment here too.\n\nThe \"forced starvation for political motivation\" you're referring to was a tragedy and a miscalculation of policy.  Stuff like that happens in third-world capitalist countries all the time.  The Great Leap Forward was intended to launch China to the forefront as a successful Socialist nation and global superpower, and it did.  In less than 70 years, China has become the world's dominant economic superpower, thanks in part to the Great Leap Forward.  China has had concurrent famines due to environmental factors for thousands of years, the Great Famine was exacerbated by Western intervention and irresponsible destruction of wildlife (something which the US was doing at the same time with DDT and Agent Orange).",

Also, there's  autonomous communities, Rojava in northeastern Syria and the Zapatista in southern Mexico, which are radically free, equal, and democratic communities that I believe would not rape and pillages the world if they had the chance. Their neighbors aren't fond of their radically democratic organization, and Rojava is in active military conflict, so I'd do my research before visiting lol.\n\nFor countries in the past, I'll have to defer to historians.\n\n>And I saw your reply to the other guy who mentioned Genghis Khan. Well think of him as the Mongol Empire. At its peak it spanned from China to Ukraine - just so you know how massive that was. And it lasted for roughly 2 centuries - surely enough barbarism had been done by then.\n\nI don't disagree the Mongol Empire was destructive. I just can't see any argument to support the notion that a continental empire that survived for 2 centuries could be more destructive than even a single global empire that lasted for more than 2 centuries let along all of the European empires combined. (For example, the British are responsible for at least as many deaths in a single country, India, than the entire Mongol Empire. Putting aside the tens of millions Africans and Indians enslaved by Westerners and the destruction of all of the US invasions.)",

Hitler had Kristallnacht and programs where so called \"undesirables\" were massacred and sent to concentration camps.

You need to identify areas of interest (the fact you've used that blanket term indicates you haven't) such as private equity, private credit, public equities, asset manegement, wealth management, investment banking etc etc) You should then cold email firms, since you're a freshman this will be especially difficult and you will probably have to send dozens, maybe 100s of emails with a low response rate.

That said, I actually did burn out a couple years ago, delayed my degree, and am currently struggling to finish it. Once you reach a point where it stops becoming novel, it's easy to feel out of place. The baggage is certainly real too.\n\nI'd recommend trying to find a student group that does work related to your degree. That, for me, was the one moment that I truly felt involved with my degree -- I was working with a student research group that dealt with data related to a variety of global issues. It was somewhat professional in nature, so I never felt like my age made me out of place, and I still got to meet others and do good work. Plus, deadlines were designed to be just lax enough that they didn't interfere too much with my classwork. I burnt out of that too, but still -- it's the one thing I truly wish I'd kept on top of.\n\nJust out of curiosity, what career is it that you're pursuing outside of your degree? It's rare that somebody in university already has a job/focus outside of school that they plan to keep long-term.",

Going to orgs allowed me to connect with my peers, which helped me make friends in classes.\n\nI totally get not wanting to be on campus.  I am that same way, and I prefer to be at home. Scheduling my classes so that way they backed up to orgs was the only way  I could even force myself to do that.\n\nI\u2019m an officer of the astronomy org, ASA, and we have a few peer mentor programs if you think that might help, as well as just advising from people who have been through what you\u2019re going through. If that sounds like something that might help, feel free to reach out :)\n\nThat being said, if the burnout is getting that bad, I\u2019d recommend dropping phys over Astro to be honest. Phys requires a few more difficult classes that Astro does not, and that might help you not have to stress as much.\n\nHope this helps!",

If so, that might be worth it!\n\nRe: being non-traditional and feeling out of place, most of my friendships while in undergrad were with grad students! I also highly enjoyed living in the ICC student co-ops and that's where most of my college friends came from (lots of non-traditional/international/working students living there, too). I also had a lot of friends that weren't in college at all and that was super helpful because they weren't as stressed as me all the time but understood why I'd disappear every end of semester.\n\nI'm in grad school (also at UT) now, and also work a full-time job. Honestly, I went to campus for classes but participate in my cohort's social events a lot. \n\n So, two paths: you can try to live it up as a student and do campus-focused things, or honestly you could try developing friendships with other people your age-ish in Austin who are not in college. Personally, I'd recommend the latter \u2013 most of my college friends moved out of Austin eventually, but most non-student friends I made while in college are still around :)",

The way most professors and lecturers think about grades is they will give you set percentages that each part of the class is worth (homeworks, mid-terms, projects, final, etc.), and you fill in those percentages as you go. Finals tend to be a substantial chunk of the grade, and while some colleges have policies around max % it can take up (I think), they can, at times, make up more than half your grade.\n\nThere is no tangiable \"grade\" you have before finishing final exam to speak of. It's not like you'll have a B up until you do the final and it goes down to a D. Instead you will have some percentage of the points in the class finished, which will probably not take you even to a passing grade, and the final fills in the rest. I guess technically that means that the final \"can't lower your grade\", but that's only because you always start with an assumed grade of zero and work yourself up, not the other way around.\n\nI would recommend you and your roommate read the class syllabus because this is a great way to fail a class for no reason whatsoever.",

I would say what you get ultimately depends on your budget. I would not recommend buying one of those cheap no-name scooters off of Amazon, as they often contain batteries that are not UL-certified, which can be a potential fire hazard. \n\nA scooter I would recommend is the Ninebot Max G30P. I currently use one to get around campus, and I've put 500 miles on it with no issues. The water resistance has been legendary, as it still works fine even after I accidentally left it outside in a giant rainstorm. The tires have also held up quite well, and they contain a self-sealing gel that is supposed to stop flats. Amazon currently has the Ninebot G30P on sale for $600, and they have the newer G30LP variant as well. Bear in mind that the G30P and G30LP are not the same scooter, even though they both fall under the \"Ninebot Max\" moniker. The G30P is larger and heavier than the G30LP, but it has much more range. My only gripes with it are the ground clearance (though this isn't much of an issue if you are riding it on mainly flat surfaces) and the thin stock grip tape (my feet were a little sore after riding it long distances, though this is easily remedied with some foam grip tape). Overall, it's been a very reliable scooter, and there's tons of aftermarket support as well. I've even gone so far as to add front suspension.\n\nRazor also makes a $600 electric scooter called the Icon, which is a re-incarnated version of their classic kick scooter. It is quite lightweight at only 26.5 pounds (compared to the Ninebot Max's 40.4 pound weight). I do not have any personal experience with this scooter, but I would presume it is decent, given how long Razor has been making scooters. However, it has solid tires and no suspension, so the ride quality will likely be quite bumpy compared to a Ninebot Max. Solid tires can also become a bit sketchy when riding fast in wet conditions. \n\nIf you're looking for full-on reviews of electric scooters, RK9 Rides posts pretty comprehensive videos on YouTube.\n\nI'd also recommend buying a good-quality U-Lock (Kryptonite is a solid brand), as cable locks can be cut quite easily by thieves.",

Like the other commenter mentioned, it's a difficult class (mostly because there's just soooo much content that's covered) but KP is super nice and helpful. The exams were hard but grading was generous (partial credit) and she offered a good amound of extra credit. She kinda does a flipped classroom thing where you watch recorded lecture videos outside of class and work on practice problems and such during class time (this format is pretty common among all the intro biochem classes from what I've heard). I personally did not take any other science courses with it besides biostats, but many of my friends took it alonside ochem 2 and managed to do well. I would suggest staying on top of the content because it's really easy to fall behind, and make sure you really understand the practice problems. I also found it helpful to think about the \"big picture\" of all the metabolic processes and how they relate/interconnect (pretty much the basis of the final exam)",

Another two classes are not attendance based (haven't gone to a single class since it's during work hours) and I get notes from friends and the prof uploads lecture slides, so I am able to keep up and review information after work. The final class is senior design, which doesn't have any class meeting times.

Even if you are able to find enough online courses to make up a 12-15 hour summer-mester, it's definitely going to be difficult (but not impossible) to do remotely well while working a 9-5.

Therefore, it's faster pace and harder to keep up with the material, especially if you work full time. 6 hours feels like a full load in a normal semester- trust me. \n\n2. Each summer class either has longer lecture hours to compensate for the shorter semester, or it has more frequent lecture times (instead of Tu/Th it meets MTWTh)\n Even taking one summer class will make it difficult to work a normal 9-5 job. You'd ideally have a job that has really flexible hours to fit your school schedule, or you have a job that allows remote work. \n\n3.  You can probably take most of all of your non-major classes in the summer, but that's not completely guaranteed. Some classes just aren't offered in the summer. When you get to upper-divison courses, there are definitely going to be classes that aren't offered in the summer. So it will definitely be a challenge to make sure your fall/spring/summer schedules are perfectly aligned to allow you to have more than  6 hours to take in the summer.",

At ASMCA, I helped restock the servers with gowns, towels, blankets, etc. and I also went into the patient rooms to restock gloves. After I finished with that I helped answer patient calls and occasionally brought them food or drink, but most of the time I had to call a PCT/RN for help. At Dell, I restocked the medication rooms and cleaned the nourishment rooms, and also answered patient calls.\n\nIMO, I liked Dell better because it's more spacious and calmer, but I think I would rather volunteer at ASMCA or Shoal Creek (Ascension's mental hospital) next semester because I can take the bus and not have to walk that much (as with Dell).",

It\u2019s all very greasy (and fried a lot of the time) and also comes in huge portions. I can literally never finish a plate of food bc it\u2019s always so much lol. \n-The way people dress. Outside of the US people tend to dress relatively nice to go to class (or at least in my experience), but here lots of people literally tend to go to class in their pajamas or in gym clothes. \n-Language. If you\u2019re not from an English speaking country then you might have a bit of trouble adjusting to speaking only English at first. \n-Tipping culture. Here it\u2019s basically expected that you\u2019ll tip 20%+ because employers refuse to pay their servers a living wage, so you have to make up for that in tips. It can get to be really expensive.\n-The culture in general and missing home. There\u2019ll be lots of times when you\u2019ll get really homesick and feel like you don\u2019t fit in here because you\u2019re from another country. But dw, all us international students have felt the same way at some point so you\u2019re not alone \ud83e\udef6\ud83c\udffb",

I'm also very skeptic about moving to the US with a Canadian degree, as it's the path everybody seems to WANT to take but rarely do you hear someone actually successful in it, which leads me to believe that it's extremely difficult.\n\nI've always been afraid of applying to US schools mainly because of the ACT/SAT requirement and the fact that I'd be international - the main concern is that I wouldn't get accepted by any worthwhile unis in the first place. My school only offers IB, which I didn't end up taking as they force you to take very specific courses when you're in IB at my school.\n\nThat being said, which unis would you recommend looking into? I honestly don't care about prestige, it's the job opportunities and location that matter most to me (I don't care about weather either, nothing down South can be worse than where I live).

What it seems to boil down to is essentially every US University charges between 50-80k USD per year without even considering residence, and from what I'm seeing, attending a US University doesn't seem to be a guarantee of being able to stay there after graduation. It's fairly common for internationals to be forced to return to their home country, and if this is what ends up happening, jobs in Canada won't even get close to paying off a US tuition.\n\nHowever, Cooper Union does seem to cover half of their tuition, which lowers their TOTAL cost (includes housing) to $46,471 USD per year. In comparison, Canadian universities will charge at most $20k USD per year with housing, $11k at most for just tuition. So even at basically the cheapest possible university, I'll be paying double the amt for a chance to have double the salary. \n\nI think the best (and basically only) possible option for me currently is to just aim for one of the well-reputed Canadian universities and move to the US with a TN Visa later on by getting a job in the US. There's just simply too much risk when it comes to studying in the US. It's a bit of a shame though.",

I'm happy with my grade 11 grades honestly, I'll try and see if I can get my school to rank me (although, since they never talk about it I doubt they will). I have no idea how applying is going to work though. If I DO meet the requirements for being considered a local applicant, but they only have my Canadian gr 11 grades to go off of, will they just put me in the international admissions category anyways? Honestly can't even blame them if they did as it's difficult to evaluate me as a local student if the only thing they have to go off of is a foreign school system.",

        "body": "It sounds like you want to go to UT. But I know It is hard to overlook the financial aspect when making decisions like this. Off the bat I (and most people) would recommend going where it\u2019s cheaper. You don\u2019t have to answer this out loud but questions you should be thinking about.\n\nHow much cheaper is rice? Is that just tuition? Think about the costs of rent and all other materials needed. \n\nHow will anything not covered by financial aid be paid for? Student loans under your name? Your parents? If it\u2019s student loans, again, how much more is UT?\n\nThere are some intangible aspects that make UT attractive, ESPECIALLY because you live in Houston. (Source, I went to UT and lived in Houston). \nYou will get more of the college experience leaving home, being in a new city, also the size and other campus aspects will be wildly different. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve visited Austin, it\u2019s a different beast than Houston. (Outdoor/water activities, music, etc)\n\nHopefully someone can chime in here or maybe you can hear from recruiters in the field and UT may be worth the extra prestige in that field, but Rice is pretty damn prestigious in itself too. How much will you make in this career? Is it enough to offset the temporary debt of going to the school you want?\n\nYou know yourself better than anyone whether in 10 years from now that extra $10k(or 20k or 30k or\u2026) of debt to go to UT is worth the experience. Most financially responsible people will say it\u2019s not worth it. I\u2019m in a mountain of debt that I wish I handled differently but I don\u2019t ever regret going to UT. I met my life partner, and my closest friends. I\u2019m a social person and it was the right fit for me. \n\nThis is one of the first decisions you\u2019ll be making in starting to become an independent ass adult. There\u2019s an on-paper decision and there\u2019s a gut-decision. It comes down to what you value. I\u2019m not trying to encourage irresponsibility, but I\u2019ve been down the road of ignoring my wants and happiness and the longer you put off standing up for your own desires the more resentment builds. Find the balance between doing what you want and what is smart to do. They\u2019re both great schools, you can\u2019t go wrong. Try and be objective and think about where you\u2019ll be in the future and maybe the decision will start to become easier. Also you can always go to one for undergrad and grad for the other.",

I agree with another commenter who said GT CS and UTCS are probably around the same caliber, so I\u2019d recommend whichever one is cheaper. Although, UT as a school in general definitely seems more fun to be at than Georgia Tech lol. As far as Turing, it\u2019s an amazing opportunity with amazing connections, however I\u2019m glad I\u2019m not in it. If you enjoy learning for the sake of learning then I think you\u2019d be a great fit, however I personally don\u2019t see the point of taking honors classes that are just going to be harder for the same credit. Especially since you said you\u2019re planning on going industry, the extra work in classes + the intense senior thesis doesn\u2019t seem worth the work. I\u2019ve heard a lot of Turing scholars drop out around then because of how difficult the thesis is, but apparently they\u2019re making it harder to drop out of Turing because of that. I\u2019d rather have more time for other interests like a social life, being in orgs, etc, but totally depends on the person! Hope that helps! :)",

I\u2019ll definitely recommend Turing over Georgia Tech as you get an amazing community where you have all your cs classes with and live with for the first year. Moreover, the honors classes are harder but are definitely worth it as you learn a lot more. Also, the classes are really small (60 ppl) and you can actually ask questions to the professor and get a lot more time with the TAs. Furthermore, it\u2019s a manageable workload and most people only drop after they got some experience and knowledge from the fundamental honor cs classes (data structures, comp arch, os) that are required the first 2 years as you complete the thesis closer to the end pf college.",

If you are looking at a fairly generic required class which would be taken by an incoming freshman (e.g. M 408C), and you will be registering during orientation, there's a decent chance that some of the classes will open up for registration during your orientation session.\n\nI suspect, though, that you are not an incoming student. As a result, I would recommend that you check out the **Continuing Students** section on [Register for a Signature Course](https://ugs.utexas.edu/sig/register) since the procedure for registering is a little... different.

I like talking to them, but that stops after the club meeting/practice ends, and then it's just everyone off on their own paths. They feel close, but also far at the same time. It's especially disheartening when all of the class stress weighs down on you and you start to reevaluate the choices that led to your social circle to become the way it is where you can't really open up to those acquaintances since they really don't know you well enough and you don't want to burden your friends with that baggage (totally not about me btw).\n\nAnyways, hang in there!

        "body": "It really sucks to see how many students in this sub are hurting for connection and meeting people/making friends where they can have a close bond.  I'm sure some of you will think I'm old and out of touch, but social media and phones have really done a number on many people, and I think it's particularly worse for anyone younger.\n\nOur phones and social media connections keep us all tethered to the past.  I keep reading in there people saying \"I don't feel the same way I did with my HS friends,\" which is just crazy to me.  When I started UT no one else I knew had email, and I couldn't afford UTLD (UT Long Distance) phone calls to keep in touch with HS friends.  I (we) were all forced to live and be present in our surroundings getting to know people and making new friends with strong bonds.  Now I'm sure I would spend my time texting, calling, facetiming my HS friends too, and it would have be detrimental to my social growth.  \n\nComing to UT was the first time I met anyone else who could talk about all three Star Wars movies for hours, had ever seen Dr. Who or Monty Python, knew any music other than what was played on top 40 radio, or hell was smart enough to even think about college or their future careers.  It was the first time I felt I could actually be my true self and not be judged or face social reprisals.  High school was absolute trash and even now, most other \"smart\" people my age would tell you, \"high school sucked, college was awesome.\"  What I came to learn was that most HS friends were just acquaintances you were close to because of proximity and time, but didn't really share any interests other than history.\n\nIt's not just young people, it's hard for everyone to not be enveloped by their \"phones.\"  I see it with people my age who are dating (because of divorce or just never had a long term relationship).  They break up with someone, but they struggle to free themselves because it's so easy for the other person to text and stay in their lives that way.  Dating at UT and after once you broke up, sure maybe there were some \"booty calls,\" but if you were determined to never see the person again, it was pretty easy to make sure you didn't.\n\nI don't know what the solution is.  I am no longer on social media (I don't really consider reddit social media, to me it's forums covering all interests, maybe most similar to newsgroups), and I think my life is better.  No more facebook stupidity from HS classmates, no more stressing about the latest outrage of the moment on twitter, and no more worrying about making sure each instagram photo is perfect.  Obviously I text friends, but I feel like I'm more in the moment at home, with shows I watch, and with my interests.  Then again I don't have to date or make new friends.\n\nMaybe someone can start a club (and be dedicated to it) for anyone wanting to go social media free or social media lite.  Have meeting or outings with no phones allowed.  Have challenges like \"go three days/one weekend/one month without texting someone from high school.\"  I know it probably sounds as dumb as a high school virginity pledge, but I don't think anyone will find the deep connections they are looking for in college if they're still focused on their high school buddies.\n\nI really wish it wasn't this way for everyone now, and the world I grew up in isn't coming back.  Just be mindful of the time and energy you're spending on the past you carry around in your pocket (HS friends), or the present is going to pass you by.",

Then, here I was, all alone with no friends, hours away from anyone I knew. It was hard. But after about a year, I just accepted it.

I can understand your parents being willing to pay for undergrad, etc, making your choice harder because attending UT doesn't look to be a financial hurdle. But if that's truly the case, ask them to gift you some of those funds to build some sort of savings since they won't be footing a bill for undergraduate education if you're at TAMU. Even if they gift you a fraction of what it would cost to be at UT, you can start a REALLY nice nest-egg for your future.\n\nGenuinely, I loved my undergrad choice -  the \"conservative\" nature of TAMU is much more hyped up than it truly is. You can easily find your niche, and most people land more purple than red anyways. College Station is no big city, but Houston and Austin are nearby and I went to concerts, football games, formals, etc. on weekends in other places frequently.\n\nYour parents/the universe are granting you a huge headstart in life here.

I would say that the majority of people I hang out with are left leaning as opposed to conservative. And regardless of political standing, the vast majority of people here are friendly.\n\nIn terms of diversity, we are 45% minority for undergrads. It isn't as much as UT, but it's still a sizeable amount. I would say STEM/pre-med majors have more diversity than the overall average and when compared to business or agriculture.\n\n**Also, while not having +/- has its perks, it can also screw you over.** It's not unheard of for people to be 0.1 points away from the A cut-off to end up with a B, which is automatically a 3.0. Professors can change the grade cut-offs, but it still can hurt if you're 0.1 points away from an A and end up with a 3.0 for the class.\n\nIn terms of class difficulty, they're both big and well respected state schools, so the difficulty of classes may not be too different. Both my friends at UT and myself at TAMU have taken our fair share of both easy and difficult classes. I have heard that the overall quality of education and teaching is better at UT though.\n\nIn complete transparency, I do have a transfer application to UT right now due to a variety of reasons. Some related to TAMU and some personal (for instance I have a stronger network of friends from high school in Austin as opposed to College Station). \n\nWhile I don't have a recommendation to give you, I hope that this info can help with your decision.

McCombs requires students to be admitted to either the Accounting or Finance minor first. This allows you to gain access to the prerequisite courses (such as ACC 311, ACC 312, and FIN 357).\n \nThe Wealth Management minor also has a competitive admissions process, whereas BEOP ACC and FIN are not competitive (meaning as long as you meet the requirements, you\u2019ll be admitted). Requiring students to enroll first in BEOP ACC or FIN allows students to have a minor officially declared in case they are not admitted to Wealth Management.\u201d \n\nAnd then I responded with: \n\u201cI guess the part I am most confused about still is the overlap between the minors. I thought the requirements for wealth management were completely different. Does that mean that when you apply, since you automatically get into Finance or Accounting (of course depending on economic statistics), then you take the classes within those while you wait to see if you were accepted into wealth management?\u201d\n\nThey responded again with:\n\u201cGreat question! Although the required courses for Wealth Management are different than those for BEOP ACC and FIN, you must meet the prereqs for Wealth Management courses before you can take the required courses. The prereqs include ACC 311, ACC 312, and FIN 357 depending on the Wealth Management course. When students are accepted to BEOP, they\u2019ll get access to ACC 311, ACC 312, and FIN 357.\n \nOnce you\u2019re admitted to BEOP ACC or FIN, you\u2019ll be able to apply to Wealth Management. While you\u2019re waiting for your admission decision for Wealth Management, you\u2019ll take the required courses for BEOP ACC or FIN which are the prereqs for the Wealth Management courses.\u201d \n\n\nTLDR: the pre-reqs for the wealth management courses are the courses you take in Finance and Accounting minors, which you are automatically enrolled in if you have a C or higher in economic statistics.",

I can always wake up early until I *actually need to*. \n\n2) Grade distribution. My GPA is clinging to threads dangling from the ceiling to stay above a 3.0. She\u2019s getting there tho. \n\n3) RMP. The percentage first, but then individual reviews. If the person\u2019s review has grammar or spelling mistakes I take their opinions with a grain of salt. \n\n4) only for my major classes, I google the professor on google scholar and read their research. The profs are doctorate students. I want to make sure their research lines up with what I want to study. I only have like two soc electives left to take so it\u2019s difficult deciding\n\n5) past syllabi if i can get the fucking website to work. It hates me",

Those bonuses brought the costs down to almost nothing each time, just a couple of dollars each time. It was Chinese food once for two meals, Mexican once for two meals, a hamburger once for two meals, some kind of roasted chicken for 2 or 3 meals.\n\nOther food included peanut butter, bread, tuna fish (terrific for lunch or dinner in a sandwich or right from the can), cheese, crackers, fruit, cereal. There was also a floor where there were meals for the players and their families and MLB staff. I didn't eat that generally because it wasn't open when I was free, but I usually took fruit from there in the morning - a couple of oranges and a couple bananas.\n\nIt was expensed, paid for by the league, but I couldn't get myself to order a $27 hamburger. On this one, they paid the receipts. On other business trips or long term events, it's been per diem. One year I was on the road for five months. The per diem for meals was $35 per day.  I accumulated $2700 from the left over per diem, and that included eating in a restaurant at least once per week.",

I don\u2019t even understand how you could guess these things by yourself. sometimes my teacher will give us a few minutes to try to figure out what will happen in a new, complicated reaction and none of us get it right bc it does against every other rule we have learned and is just an exception",

In retrospect, the quizzes def are easier than the tests, but that\u2019s just cuz I studied way harder for the tests and the quizzes finally made sense to me.

However, if there's material that's entirely new to you the class makes it deceptively easy; nothing in this class ever becomes hard in the sense that it becomes overbearingly complicated, it's more so that you really have to know the underlying principles behind key reactions to a deep degree.",

I\u2019m pretty sure the only reason for that is quantum mechanical and not something easily explained by undergrad ochem2 terms. Obviously if people know they are good with working things out by themselves then this class may work, i was just giving another stance on that ochem is not an \u201ceasy\u201d class, although i would argue it gets easier over time once you have the basics down bc like you said, you can predict a lot of what will happen",

You get special advising. \n\nMy daughter is very very involved in leadership on campus (the UT Senate of College Councils) and that\u2019s a fantastic path to meeting people, especially if you\u2019re government focused anyway. (There is also a Student Government, which has its own Supreme Court). \n\nRice is a fabulous school as well. So you have amazing choices here, as well as in other states! \n\nHave you visited and done the Plan II tour? They give a lot of info there. Yes, you can double major in 4. It\u2019s very common.",

You also receive loans if you haven\u2019t accepted the max amount of loans during the school year. I suggest talking to one stop since they can see your records and tell you how much you will be eligible to receive. Also if you take over 6hrs in the summer you will need to report it after the financial aid letters are posted since what we will receive is only for 6hrs. If you report they\u2019ll might give you more money to cover the extra 3hrs. Hope this helped!",

And I definitely understood, since those are very important. I waited 1-2 weeks, reached out again, received no answer back, and the semester ended.\n\nTA B for class B responded back in a reasonable time with explanations. They responded back in about 2-3 days or so, at most 5 days. If some accommodations were difficult, they explained why(and it was very understandable), and still offered to help as much as they could. They also gave out emails to check in with their students to help study for exams(summarizing key points of what to study for) and indicate any changes in discussion times(location, time, etc).\n\nOf course most of the TAs are in between the two.

In some ways, academia distracts us from the growth we need most in our lives. Taking a break might allow you to blossom into who you really are. Maybe your future still exists in CS. Maybe you\u2019ll find a thousand different ways for you to achieve that. But your health and safety comes first.

It is important to be completely honest with them, because they can only help you out as much as you let them in on your situation. They will likely ask you to provide \u201csufficient\u201d documentation of a medical emergency to petition the Dean of the College for a medical withdrawal. This can be easily achieved by an official doctor\u2019s note from your Therapist that explicitly states that you\u2019re struggling with poor mental health preventing you from finishing the semester. The Dean of the College will review the documentation, and will most likely grant you the Medical Withdrawal. This will withdraw you from all of your classes for this semester, and it will show up as a W on your transcript (W\u2019s are better than F\u2019s). At this point, you can return to the university in the Fall Semester easily without applying for readmission or you can voluntarily take a longer leave of absence. Most importantly, you will remain on scholastic probation with the same cumulative GPA as last semester, so it is important to set yourself up with a plan for success upon your return. Be intentional with your time away from your studies. Spend the summer with your loved ones and be open about your life with them. Take the time to reflect on your life and gather yourself together before making any big decisions about returning to your studies. You will know when you are ready. Trust me, everyone goes through their own struggles in life, but it\u2019s how you recover that matters the most.",

I also got diagnosed with depression around that time, which helped me. It didn\u2019t matter to my family though. No one believed in me and no one helped me go back to school. My family was ashamed of me.\n\nHere\u2019s what I did to get back to school. I found a job immediately to pay for my expenses.. retail or food, and then keep looking everyday for another job that\u2019s full time and professional. There\u2019s lots of jobs that\u2019s don\u2019t need a degree and this will give you more experience and let you see different careers. I spent a year doing work full time in a government office while I\u2019ll figured out my next move. \n\nAt my university you only have a limited time to return to school.. I think you needed to return before 3 semesters passed or then you\u2019d need to reapply to the university. It was difficult but I worked a semester completely remote full time and worked my job full time to retake some classes I previously failed to boost my gpa. I went from a 1.3ish to a 2.0 after 1 semester of grinding. This was all in consultation with my advisor.. I had to jump through a lot of hoops and meet with a lot of people to put a plan in place to get me back in school. \n\nThen after the 1 semester of grinding, I was able to apply for a major I liked and switch into it - back to being a normal college student. So it took me a year and a half of working hard to get back into school normally, but totally worth it. And the 1.5 years let me really think about and experience different careers. \n\nI only wrote out my story because I just wanted to tell you.. it\u2019s okay. Get yourself help. There are people who have failed and managed to overcome it. You can do it as well. You just need to take 1 step at a time",

If so, talk to your therapist about options to apply for an academic appeal based on clinically diagnosed depression (if you suffer from that.) even if it doesn\u2019t go through, just know you did your best to save your GPA from a semester of severe and unfortunate mental illness.\n\nIf you can\u2019t apply for an academic appeal or it fails - don\u2019t worry! Just keep moving, damage control is still very possible. You can look also look into taking incomplete grades for at least a couple classes so hopefully you can prevent a semester full of Fs. Again - if not, don\u2019t worry!\n\nAfter trying those routes, it sounds like you need to take time away to figure out what you want your future to look like and how/if academia fits into that. I was formerly a chemical engineering student and went through multiple depressive episodes of hell before finally admitting that it just wasn\u2019t for me. I took a year off, completely repaired my life, changed majors and even got into UT as a transfer doing what I love!\n\nTry your best to repair any havoc your mental state has caused, focus on you and future you, make the plan and it will all turn out. It\u2019s a lot of work, but very rewarding - especially when you finally break free and can enjoy life again. I wish you the best of luck!",

I'm so sorry that you're going through this; it sounds extremely difficult and stressful :((( I was in a similar situation to you my sophomore year-- I transferred to UT and had a very hard time with the transition. This was immediately post-COVID also and my first semester of any in-person college. A severe mental health crisis ruined my GPA of my entire sophomore year.\n\nHere's what I recommend/here are some University-related outlets that you can reach out to for support if you decide that continuing college is right for you: \n\n\\- CMHC can assess you for accommodations needs! I didn't know this, but they can refer you to D&A (Disability & Access) and you can get accommodations through CMHC/D&A without having to pay for extensive and expensive testing somewhere else. I'm not sure if this goes for all mental health conditions, but it was the case for mine that I could get consulted at CMHC and get accommodations. If you'd like to do this, I recommend reaching out to CMHC as soon as you can! \n\n\\- Talk to the dean of your specific college. If you are failing your classes this semester AND you visit CMHC as soon as possible (I don't know how soon because the end of the semester is almost here), you may qualify for *non-academic* Q-drops. Classes that you are failing will get dropped from your transcript and will not take up your OTE or one of your 6 Q-drops. While there will be a dropped course, they will not affect your GPA and you can retake them when you feel more ready and once you've resolved this thing that you are going through.\n\n\\- Change majors ASAP. If there is another major in your college that you're interested in (CS is in CNS I believe), definitely switch! See what you're interested in! It's not worth it to pursue a major you hate. It's significantly easier to complete classes that you care about. It's much easier to switch into a different major of the same college, but if you really hate CNS, you can also apply for an internal transfer into a different college. While you are waiting for your internal transfer decision, take gen-ed classes that you like or take classes at ACC! \n\nPlease remember that you are not a failure for needing help or for changing majors or for things not going the way you planned. I wish you the best of luck. Please PM me if you'd like to talk. Again, I'm so sorry that you're going through this.",

If you have to go NC with anyone who doesnt understand what you\u2019ve gone through, then do that. You dont owe anyone but yourself a college degree.

Several factors can come into play with the decision to allow you back to UT and under what conditions. Having gone through the process and knowing other people that also have gone through it having a disability or diagnosed issue can open up certain avenues to getting back into UT. It also can give you a break from the stress of UT, and I think it may give you an option to modify your course schedule.

Straumanis boosts grades greatly and his groupwork (POGIL) approach to teaching was so much better for my learning than lecture style like I had in o chem one (I did not have Shabbir for o chem one, I should note). Straumanis adds 15-30 points to every midterm and does everything he can to make getting an A as easy as possible. His class being \"easier\" does not mean you don't learn, you learn A LOT. I have heard horrible things about Shabbir's tests, including that tons of people left her o chem one final bawling. However, she is apparently a good lecturer so it really comes down to if you want a less stressful/groupwork style class or a more stressful/lecture style class.\n\nI wouldn't think about preparation for the MCAT in making your decision, too many students have done the same and ended up suffering in Shabbir. The MCAT only asks around 10 o chem questions and you will be prepared for them no matter which teacher you take. If you are worried about having to take Shabbir for o chem two, don't be. There are many o chem two teachers offered in the Spring and she won't be the only option left.",

Straumanis cares for his students and simply wants them to learn o chem without the stress of grades that consumes students, especially pre-meds. He always adds 15-30 points to everyone's tests (he does not cap the grade at a 100 either, so you could get a 120+ on an exam) and quizzes always have bonuses. The class is groupwork-based using his own workbook he published, and I found it to be so much better for learning than normal lectures like I had in o chem one. The only thing is you will have to put in a lot of work outside of class to really understand the concepts and prepare for the weekly quizzes and midterms (only two compared to four for a lot of other classes). I will be an LA for his o chem one class next semester and I can tell you that the LAs and TAs are extremely approachable and helpful as you \"catch the wave,\" as Straumanis likes to say. As for genetics, I have not heard about that teacher, but you should be able to access past years' ecis results to see what former students thought about the class. RMP helps too. Hope this helps.",

CAP has very specific requirements about the number of hours you need to complete in-residence from specific approved course lists; deviating from the set requirements can impact your CAP agreement and transferring to UT-Austin afterwards. (I'm not sure if this is answering your question.)\n\nAs u/samureiser mentioned, AP for CAP once you arrive at UT-Austin works the same as it does for everyone else. If you have a score that will give you credit for a course (that you didn't already take), you can claim credit along those guidelines.",

I can't say much about the other schools since I didn't go there, but if I were you I would go to a school that would cost the least once I finish. I would try to do the Turing program since companies know that program and 100% of my peers I knew did internships at well-known start-ups at the time Yelp, Google, Salesforce, Facebook (now Meta), etc.\n\nInterviewers care more about your personality and technical skills during your interviews mid-career. However, early in your career, some employers only recruit certain schools initially but if you do internships they will offer you a job. If I had to rank prestige it would be Georgia Tech, Cornell, and UT, but if you do good on your interviews and classes it really doesn't matter since UT CS is pretty good. GPAs only matter for your first few years, after that no one asks or gives a shit. Don't worry about recessions since the average one only lasts 1 year and you'll be in school for 4-5 years.\n\nRegarding the student community, I can only speak for UT. It is a public university with a shit ton of students so it is only how you make it. You can create a community or just do everything on your own.\n\nAt the end of the day, minors are great but employers are hiring for a specific role so they don't really give 2 shits about a minor. College is pretty time-consuming and 95% of the kids I knew freshman year who were pursuing double degrees dropped 1 major. You are not going to be paid more for having a minor. You can double major in business, but you might not have a life lol.\n\nIf I was in your shoes, I would go to the school for the best price so that I will have the least amount of student loans. That shit will kill you later on, especially with today's interest rates. A CS degree is not worth $300k where you have to pay $3k a month for 10 years. I finished with $30k in loans and bought my first house at 23 in Austin where my friends were slaving away at their loans.",

I have not felt any cutthroat so far.\n\n4. With a lot of AP, it\u2019s not difficult to do a double major(many who does so double majors in math because of overlapping degree requirements). With some grind it\u2019s even possible to triple major. Idk about quadruple as that will depend on AP/major/etc\n\n5. Not eno knowledge to comment\n\n6. I like the taking any electives, because the electives essentially dive into deeper parts about a specific field of CS. I think the core classes set you up in a way that all the electives are just further branching/exploration into specific subjects that might entertain you more.\n\n7.

        "body": "I did an undergrad in CS at Cornell somewhat recently and a PhD in CS at UT very recently so I feel I'm somewhat uniquely qualified to answer part of this question. I want to first preface that I really enjoyed my time at both schools and think both are great! So rather than spout things like prestige (lol at someone who thought Yale was a top CS program among the ivies. Phenomenal school but easily bottom half among the ivy league in CS.) and US News rankings, let me compare them directly:\n\n1. The TA-student ratio is much higher at Cornell than UT in CS. This may not seem like much, but it meant the assignments got graded within a couple of days rather than over a week, tests were often graded within 4 hours, office hours were available nearly 24/7, and piazza often had a near single digit average response time. The difference was actually shocking to me when I first arrived at UT.\n2. Ithaca is gorges, but most people will enjoy Austin more. If you like natural beauty, Ithaca has it in spades; I always enjoyed walking by waterfalls on the way to class. That said, getting to Ithaca sucks, full stop. The bus drive from NYC is long and often had no signal through parts of the ride. Flying to Syracuse or Ithaca directly is often a major hassle. There's also way more things to do in Austin like better food, concerts, sports games (as well as UT having much better sports program outside of hockey and lacrosse). If you're the kind of student to bury your head in academics, like me, this may not affect you as much, but how boring Ithaca can be should not be understated.\n3. From my very small sample size as a TA at UT, the core courses at UT are a little easier than the ones at Cornell. I've been very impressed by many Turing students in some of the elective courses I've TA-ed though.\n4. It goes without saying that being close to NYC, the finance options at Cornell will be better. The ones from UT aren't bad whatsoever, so you aren't shooting yourself in the foot by going to UT, but it's definitely a plus for Cornell. For big tech like FAANG, not sure there's much of a difference.\n5. There is a lot less bureaucracy at Cornell by nature of being much smaller. If you decide you don't want to do CS, switching majors and even colleges will be very easy. To highlight this, even switching into CS is considerably easier. I wasn't even a CS major until my senior year, when I added it as my second major just because I could. Getting relevant CS courses at Cornell seems to be a lot easier too based on complains I see from CS majors here at UT. If you are interested in things outside CS, the courses in those departments at Cornell will, on average, be better than ones you would take at UT. But unless its something like Native American studies, probably not by much; UT is also a great school!\n6. I want to re-emphasize point 2. Ithaca is not for everyone. There's snow on the ground in March and classes will happen even during a blizzard. Some of the older dorms don't even have A/C. Many of my friends from warmer climates hated their four years there.\n7. Last but not least, you are more than your university/name on your degree. A rockstar student will succeed everywhere, almost by definition. If the added tuition causes you undue stress, it's not worth it.\n\nTl;dr You won't go wrong with either. Tuition aside Cornell > UT slightly in academics and access to finance and CS but Ithaca << Austin for most people.",

It's not really a factor imo, class size doesn't really affect the teaching quality. Great experience with the professors. Obviously you are going to have some professors that are more highly rated among the students than others but again, this is standard.\n* Recruiting scene is pretty good. Always some recruiting events on campus and etc. I mostly just applied myself and had a good outcome, so did most of my friends. UT name should get you past most filters since it's a target school. Honestly you wouldn't have trouble recruiting with any of those 3 so I wouldn't really about that aspect\n* Everyone is pretty collaborative, UT is more of a chill school I'd say.\n* Ummm not sure if i'd recommend double majoring in engineering bc that makes the course load really really cramped, even with AP. Doubling in business is do-able course wise but I don't know the specifics. BSA degree for CS is specifically designed so you can pursue other interest so maybe look into that\n* Trivial\n* Eh you can do BS or BSA\n* As long as it's decent you are fine. You don't need a 4.0 for the industry\n\nTo add on, other comments stress on turing but personally (non turing) I've had a great experience without it. Professors are still going to be great and there is no real difference in what is taught/recruiting so if you dont get turing i wouldn't be too wrapped up by that. if you do, that's great also.  \nI'd just take the cheapest of the three.",

However, once you get interviews, you are on the same playing field as students from any other school in the country even if they are ranked a little higher (MIT, Stanford, Cornell, etc). How well you perform and your internship outcomes will mostly depend on how hard you work at developing skills and studying for the interviews. Your classes will introduce you to the topics you\u2019ll need to know, but you will likely need to study on your own anyways. That\u2019s why I feel like school doesn\u2019t matter that much for most tech jobs, with quant maybe being an exception.\n\nFor me, some cons about UT compared to private universities are how rigid our degree plans are and how we get less overall attention and guidance from university faculty because it\u2019s such a large school. I feel like my college experience would have had more breadth and diversity in the class I took and experiences I had if I went to a private school. \n\nThat being said, UTCS is still a great program and I do recommend it because at the end of the day what you get out of the program (or any program at any school) will be determined by how you take advantage of the resources you have.",

Typically my teams have been hodgepodges of people from different schools. When you notice differences in skill level among engineers, you really don't attribute it to where they went to school, you just attribute it to somebody being really smart. So if you're worried about being the best engineer you can be, school can matter some, but wherever you go just focus on learning the most you can, doing the most coding you can, and working your way to being a kickass engineer.",

Aside from Austin itself, one thing that appealed to me about UT was that more people are non-STEM majors, so it adds to the diversity.\n\nSocially, UT is much better because there is much more to do for college students off campus. GT is very much focused on the on-campus fraternity life for social aspects.\n\nIronically, one thing that also appealed to me about UT was the football was much bigger, but GT won the orange bowl while I was there, and UT, well\u2026. We won a Sugar Bowl and went through 3 coaches. Lol\n\nBoth schools are great, and you\u2019ll get a great degree, but they\u2019re VERY different socially and atmospherically.

My TAs are great and this might be my favorite class this semester which is a surprise because I don't particularly enjoy pchem. The structure of the lab makes it so much less stressful than other labs.\n\nAs for time commitment, I spend an average of 2-3 hours per report outside of class time (you get time during class to work on the report and ask questions). Prelabs take virtually no time at all. That averages out to less than 1 hour per week. Some people in my group finish their reports in class and do nothing outside of class. Apparently the TAs were told to grade harshly but everyone in my group receives good grades.\n\nI guess it's very TA dependent. Good luck!",

Going for a run/walk around Town Lake is nice, but I'd do that in the morning before it gets too hot. Nightlife downtown is pretty active in the summer if you're into drinking and dancing. A daytrip down to San Marcos to float the river if you want to get out of town for a day. UT baseball season goes into the summer. Hit AFS up if you're into films. Make a game of how many different patio margaritas you can have in one day. Play a around of BYOB mini golf at Peter Pan after dark. Blanton museum is always interesting and well air conditioned. There's a bunch of fun vintage stores all around town that can be fun to explore. Get a big lemonade at the farmer's market at Mueller on Sunday mornings. Watch the bats come out of the South Congress bridge at sunset. \n\nNo shortage of things to do in the summer and you don't have waste it hunkering down inside, but best not to plan outdoor activities away from water in the afternoon.",

        "body": "I feel like I had a similar experience at UT to what you're experiencing.  \n  \nI feel like UT, more so than other schools, you're forced in to making friends in more of an \"adult\" manner bc there is no dorm culture, classes are so big that it's hard to meet people that you really like, and half of the clubs/orgs require a 3 part interview process to get in.  \n  \nI also really liked high school and had a lot of friends. But at UT you can't just rely on making friends in your classes, even if it was ez for you in the past.  \n  \nI have some suggestions, these are all things that helped me find a really well rounded group of friends by the time I graduated.  \n1) Try to take \"for fun\" classes. Take weight training (even if you're not athletic) or social dance or take an art class. Anything that gives you more opportunities to meet more people without having to sit through another lecture. I feel like @UT lectures were just straight info dumps for 50-90 minutes that there was no time to chat or meet classmates.  \n2) Try and find at least 1 \"interview\" club. These can be very tight knit and close groups of people, so try and find one that you're genuinely interested in what they're doing. If you're in McCombs/stats person it could be UCF (Undergraduate Computational Finance) or UBC (Undergraduate Business Council) or if you play an instrument you could audition for University Orchestra (non-major symphony orch) or audition for UT Mariachi. If you're CS there's the CS frat (idr the name) or Code Orange (goes and volunteers at schools to teach kids CS). Etc etc, also in a similar vein you could join an intramural team or join the rowing team. I've heard amazing things about how tight knit UT rowers are, you do have to get up at like 4 am tho. This group also includes Spirit Groups + Greek Life! \n3) Try to find a non-interview club. Something that you can just show up to and enjoy. While this will be a less tight knit group of people, it'll give you the most exposure to a bunch of different people so that you have the best likelihood of meeting friends. Something like an Anime Club or Lions Club (I think everyone gets in) or Microfarm or Running Club.  \n4) Adult friendships are going to be different. It's waaayyy more likely that you're going to have 1 friend that you go to the gym with + 1 friend that you get coffee with + 2 people you study chem with + 1 person you prep for interviews with than it is that you have 5-10 people you do everything with and that's ok!!! \n  \nI hope it gets better for you!! It took a little time and changing the way I was thinking, but it def did for me",

Minimum wage in NYC is $15 an hour; we're talking a 10 hour a week part-time job during most but not all of the school year if you want to avoid debt.  If you worked half time during the summer you'd have more than half the year saved up. \n\nNYU is a bit better than UT in ranking. You can compare program by program for your interests, and NYU actually lets you switch majors with ease (NOT true for many majors at UT).  You can take a general studies liberal path for up to two years before you have to commit. For an easy example, you can major in business - a permanent, solid degree for any life path - at NYU with relative ease (and in a nominally better ranked program, though they are both top 10 consistently). With UT its super competitive.  If you got into CS or something like that where UT is clearly better I think you would have an argument, but you don't seem to be interested in those majors. \n\nI stayed at home one year of college and I really cannot emphasize how much you lose commuting. While Austin is a great city and I don't think you should necessarily knock it out of all your future plans, NYU really is a unique opportunity that I don't think I would pass up if I were in your shoes. You will not have many opportunities like this just handed to you in life.",

I ended up going a more Biology route but now am in grad school doing things tangential to environmental history. So, basically I've been looking at jobs in all field and have some tips.\n\nFirst, I'd say if you want to be a teacher look into UTeach if it is still around. When I was there I think it was more focused on STEM? But still, great resources, you get teaching experience. Overall a good choice if that is what you actually want to do. \n\nIf you don't, History really sets you up for knowing how to write and communicate well and you can definitely leverage that. Also for skills like data management and such if you get more involved with the research side of things.\n\nI personally wish, for both my biology and history degrees, that I would have taken some GIS classes. GIS is a mapping software and is VERY employable but is also...well honestly it's a pain in the ass to use. So having a GIS certificate would really make you stand out depending on the sort of job you want to do! I know government jobs it's really desirable. \n\nHope that helps! Grad school is also a thing- I'm in Anthropology not History but if you have any questions I'd be happy to answer them. And good luck with your History degree! I honestly loved most of my professors and History classes at UT.",

You might not come out of college immediately with a killer job like a comp sci major might, but a history major teaches you a lot of \u201csoft skills\u201d that can be applied in many fields. A lot of law students major in history as undergrads, it can be good for corporate or business jobs, it can be a great setup for different types of government work, and the field of history itself also boasts a ton of different opportunities (ex. I know a 3D modeling/history specialist who researches and makes digital recreations of sites from the past). Also if you\u2019re more into academics specifically, history professors actually get payed very well as opposed to teachers (though it\u2019s definitely a long and difficult path to get there).",

I also notice there are some comments mentioning this as an option for you. While that \\*might\\* be a good route for you, I would caution you.\n\nI was a gov. major at UT that ultimately became a law school dropout (voluntary, not due to grades or finances); in short, I ultimately decided the field would be pretty soul sucking. But I wasn't unique: a shockingly large number of people that go to law school also find out they're not well suited for the legal profession, only its usually after they've become lawyers and they feel they're in too deep to change paths. Lawyers have some of the highest rates of suicide and substance abuse among any common professions and they have one of the lowest rates of reported job satisfaction. If you tell lawyers  you're considering law school many will immediately and instinctively reply with some form of \"yeah, don't\".\n\nMany people believe lawyers are typically rich, but this is not at all the case. Most lawyers start off making in the $45K-$75K range, roughly. And there may be good opportunity to make more, in time, with the right firm, but this will often take years of poor work-life balance. It's really firm dependent though because non-huge firms have more variability in how they conduct business. A small subset of law grads have sufficient grades to go into \"big law\" (generally, the better the law school the greater proportion of grads that go into big law) which pays up towards $200K starting, but which is also notorious for working young lawyers to the bone until they burn out (80 hour weeks are commonly cited), or after years, can finally graduate to a lighter workload. The \"public interest\" legal jobs that many people are attracted to are infamous for poor pay. Public sector is usually relatively poor pay as well. Also consider it may take a considerable amount in loans to attend law school depending on your stats and the school you choose, in addition to the 3-year opportunity cost.\n\nThere are some people that are well suited to the legal profession, but my estimate is that it's less than half of people that matriculate into law school. IF this option appeals to you, I would highly encourage you to intern in a legal office and speak to lawyers that are willing to talk about their career \\*in depth\\*. This will give you a better idea of if you're actually one of the people that should go to law school.",

I minored in English, but should have done the Business Foundations minor instead.  Even so, my writing ability has been far more important at jobs than anything history.  Overall I should have done a business degree.  It would have been much more useful career-wise.  Business Foundations is dead, but I'm almost positive there is a business minor for not McCombs school students.  Don't try to wedge yourself into law school if you're not interested, you'll be miserable.\n\nSomething I didn't understand entering UT was that you don't go to study something you like to \"learn more.\"  You're going to college to set yourself up for a career that at minimum will put a roof over year head, allow you to eat, go out every once in a while, vacation every so often, and have some down time.\n\nAfter graduating I got an AAS in \"IT\" and have been working in tech for 20 years.

Pick up the elements of computing certificate and put it on your resume as the CS minor that it actually is so recruiters recognize it.

But If the OP instead values something like job fulfillment, then maybe teaching is a better fit for them, and the tradeoff of low upward job mobility is worth it. It's really dependent on what the OP currently thinks they want in the future. If they're a senior in HS going into college though, I would definitely encourage the OP to be optimistic about whatever choice they make.

Some quick math, r/teachers has around 421k members.

My assumption is that if we treat the reddit posts as samples it would probably bias towards the negative. It's analogous to when we buy electronics and such.

If you'll be looking for a job after you graduate, it's probably best to stick it out as long as you pass the class. C's get degrees and everyone and their mom knows ochem is hard. Lots of people get their worst grade ever in ochem. Plus, as someone else said, it'll still be hard the second time through if you drop and retake it. Having a drop on your transcript looks really bad and anyone who sees that will probably assume the worst. Take the C, move on, and keep doing well in your other classes so you maintain a decent GPA (employers don't really look into GPA too much anyway from what I've heard).\n\nIf you're prehealth or something similar it might be a different story because GPA matters way more. I'm not prehealth so I can't speak to that too much but in that case you should talk with an advisor to see what the best move is.\n\nEither way, you'll get a much more meaningful response if you ask your professor compared to random people on Reddit so I think that should be your first move.",

I think the webpage for 314's class might be open over the summer, and the first assignment may be posted then. So if you really wanted to, you could start on it.\n2) Whatever laptop you think will last you, no an iPad is not necessary but could be nice. Really up to you.\n3) You'll meet with an advisor in orientation.\n4) Touch up on Java and if you're an overachiever start learning some C.

I have to say it's the hardest course I've taken at UT so far (way harder than MechE Thermodynamics which many people consider to be a very hard course but I disagree).\n\nAt least it's not at WEL 2.122, because that room has the worst projectors ever. Definitely do homework, which you don't turn in but quizzes and tests may have the exact same questions. Also, this course is very fast-paced, so don't fall behind or you will experience hell trying to catch up (like me). Be prepared to rush super hard on the exams\u2014this class made me appreciate the exams I get in engineering courses. Basically, this course made me not want to take another CNS course ever again (which I don't have to because I'm done with all of them for my degree plan).\n\nGood thing is that she gives generous extra credit opportunities because the class as a whole usually does not do good on exams. I got 6.5 extra credit points added to my final grade and eventually crawled out of that class with an A.\n\nStudy hard and you'll do fine. Good luck.",

Once I learned that you could do any major, I picked history. The stories of my family and the city that I come from are rooted in deep history. History was always a major part of my life, and I knew that I wanted to explore it further. What I did not realize is both the opportunities I would receive and would not receive at UT. For example, not having the option of FRI was quite limiting to the sorts of research that I wanted to do. On the other hand, I have been able further to explore the history of medicine, specifically in Texas. For me, majoring in History has been a breath of fresh air as well as an exhilarating aspect of my academic career. It has allowed me to explore interdisciplinary subjects. As they say, medicine is as much an art as it is a science. I have been able to transcend both fields and see how they can overlap. It is certainly not easy being the only one in my track doing this, but I am confident because others have done it before. Hope this helps!",

You\u2019re almost guaranteed at that point to not get a UGS. One of the big points of orientation is making connections with those around you so that you aren\u2019t shell shocked when you get thrown in somewhere huge and new. NSS works SO hard to make orientation as good as possible so that students feel confident coming into university.

If you\u2019re dead set on doing at least a double major though, just keep the BHP and MechE and run with that; that in itself will help you tremendously with networking, research, and recruiting which\u2014from your other responses in this thread\u2014seem like what you\u2019re looking for the most. \n\nJust make sure you keep your grades up, I\u2019d say at least above a 3.2 GPA, and try not to burn out.\n\nAlso, fuck Finance, it\u2019s basically irrelevant for what you want to pursue which is a nuclear/energy engineering start-up? Not really sure, but from what it sounds like MechE and I suppose a Gen Business background would be helpful, but I have no clue how you\u2019re gonna factor in Finance lol.\n\nHonestly, for Business, you could also just do a Business minor and/or an MBA after undergrad, if you wanted\u2014although McCombs and BHP in general are pretty kick-ass for recruiting and networking so I suppose you should consider keeping that on your radar.\n\nTLDR: Your priority should be MechE, BHP, and basically don\u2019t even include Finance in the picture. It also might just be better to just to do MechE, and also minor in Business for that Business background. \n\nGood luck!\n\nEdit: Goddamn, how are you even real?! You alr got a $10K scholarship and a research position and you\u2019re not even in college yet lmao",

In the same vein, most people who are pursuing a Finance major are doing so to get a job in Finance/IB/etc. You literally could just do a Finance minor and still get a foundation in investing, curating a portfolio, managing finances, etc. There really is no reason to pursue Finance as a major rather than just a minor unless that\u2019s what you want to do as a career\u2014and considering it seems that you\u2019ll probably go into energy engineering and not corporate, it\u2019s just an unnecessary challenging course-load to add on top of the tough engineering and BHP classes.\n\nUnlike business, which (unless it\u2019s a field like IB or accounting where you need a level of education and certification in the field) you can do on your own\u2014if you want to do engineering, you need to major in engineering\u2014so still see if you can either transfer to MechE or double major in MechE and BHP. Considering what you plan on doing, a degree in Engineering is imperative to even sort of get a foot into the industry let alone have people take you seriously.\n\nI\u2019d say you should major in MechE and minor in Nuclear Engineering for sure, and if you think you can handle it, add the BHP major or Business minor on top of that.",

The estimate in COA uses the price of the lowest-priced residence only, so you have to keep that in mind. I never live in the dorms, but I believe there's no guarantee that you could live in the dorm that you signed up for? The cost of living on campus includes room + utilities + food, which is nice, but if you want to cut down some costs, I think living off campus is cheaper. The current housing rate is $13,058/10 month, which makes it around $1,300/month. If you choose to live further away from campus and cook at home, you could down the cost to $1000-1100/month.\n\nYou already exclude personal expenses and transportation so I'll not comment on that. But except for flight tickets to Austin, I don't think you have to pay for transportation in Austin bc students can take the bus for free in the city. Now for books + supplies, I don't know what textbooks they require for ME, but there are ways to find cheaper textbooks and I don't think it will ever cost $724/year.\n\nSo yea, except tuition and housing (seems like you choose to live on campus), other expenses really vary depending on your usage.",

I do recall there being a tall-ish (not a high rise) new & modern co-op (I.e. you have to work there as well) in West Campus which may have cheaper options, it\u2019s called Laurel Nueces & Halstead Co-Op. \n\nNorth Campus has older apartments and houses. Hyde Park is a sleepy neighborhood with lots of trees, good restaurants, garage apartments, and some older apartments. The houses are old (100 year old bungalows) that have a lot of charm. \n\nAll of these are good locations to consider.\n\nI have no idea what $1000 can get you. I went to grad school at UT 10 years ago and split an older two BR a block north of campus for $1400 ($700/person). The apartment is called River Oaks and is on Medical Arts. After a decade of Austin becoming substantially more expensive, I can\u2019t imagine what they cost now.\n\nOther places you may want to consider: East Side off of Manor, grad student housing, or Far West.\n\nNone of these locations allow you to walk or bike to campus so if you want that, don\u2019t look any further. You could probably bike from the east side but you have to cross an interstate. That said they all have buses that frequently go into campus if you don\u2019t want to drive.\n\nThe east side doesn\u2019t have high rises but they do have newer apartments with similar amenities. Far West is older and doesn\u2019t have high rises \u2014 a lot of grad students live there so it\u2019s worth mentioning. Grad student housing, again not high rises, but I believe they have newer offerings and they\u2019re in prime locations (e.g. downtown). A lot of the grad student housing is older and really dumpy but I believe they\u2019ve built newer things which may be available at a discount.\n\nGood luck!",

It is a little far to walk but you can always take a bus or bike! I heard the buildings there are a little old though.\n\nI would also recommend getting an agent to look at apartments. You don't have to pay broker fee in Austin so you can see a bunch of apartments before signing one! There are very familiar with areas where grad students live so you can always tell them about your budget/neighborhood you want etc. Try and look for roommates while doing the apartment search as well so you can look for apartments together!",

I hope someone who took a CH204 lab along with FRI in their sophomore year can put in their two cents so you can get a more accurate idea of what the workload is like, but I took CH204 along with FRI and my other freshman science classes so I can share my experience:\n\nI had no problems doing CH204 (as of now, I have an A- in the class) along with my FRI lab (current grade is A). Although this sounds like a lot of time to spend in the lab (and ngl it kinda is), I spent around 7 hours each week in the lab but the work in my FRI is low-stress. CH204 also didn't cause me much grief, but it is very much just busywork, so I spent A LOT of time writing pre-labs and lab reports (at least 3 hours on each lab report). I also have A's in my other science classes, but I have \"easier\" professors so it may have made my semester less stressful for me and possible to have this schedule",

If you were take upper-level classes for everything in replacement for the introductory level stuff, you would have a pretty rough time unless you were majoring in a physical science, namely chemistry or physics. Even then it's tough. \n\nAfter general physics, physics gets REALLY hard -- physics C is a literal joke at this point. You are constantly solving nasty problems where the concepts begin to blur and math gets really messy. Unless you really want to be bogged down with problem sets that take hours of intense concentration while maintaining your sanity through a 10 page problem (most people don't have this type of patience), I would strongly advise against taking upper level physics on top of anything else that you would need for med school. Especially if you took upper level chemistry and biology courses with physics, that would be a nightmare to work through (Source: I'm a physics major). \n\nAlso I would not advise taking any super hard classes on top of premed prerequisites because the priority is to maintain high grades in everything. You might be happier with a few more easy classes while you have ochem 1/2 on your plate -- those two classes are notorious for being difficult, and biochem after that gets pretty dicey too. \n\nPlus some schools don't even take AP credits for prerequisite courses. Save your GPA and your sanity while you can.",

So this means you can apply to transfer to ECE from ME from fall 23 to Spring 24. This is only open to Cockrell freshman so you would be competing against other engineering freshman to transfer in. People say it\u2019s impossible to transfer engineering majors but it truly isn\u2019t as crazy as they make it out to be. It is very doable to get a 4.0 your first semester at UT if you\u2019re diligent and take the right classes! Really try to get a 4.0 your first semester and you will have a strong chance at getting accepted. \n\nAlso I am current ME freshman who was in the exact same boat as you regarding wanting to transfer to ECE. I decided against it because ultimately I know I will like Mechanical better and got caught up in wanting to SWE and other roles I wouldn\u2019t be happy in! Really take your time the first semester to talk to upperclassmen in both ECE and MechE to really see which you would like. I decided to MechE + elements of computing certificate because I realized that worked better with my goals rather than changing my major. \n\nEither path you do end up going, best of luck. Feel free to PM me if you have any more questions!",

First reason is that it gives you some to take some courses mainly ME 302 and see if you enjoy it and want to stick with it. Secondly is that for internal transfer you only get two tries. Even if you have a 4.0 after your first semester, it is still very possible to get rejected to ECE. Plus you are able to take the same intro ECE classes the spring semester that you would regardless if you switched into the major or not (ECE 302 and 306) so there is really no reason to switch after one semester. I\u2019m a freshman in ME rn doing the same thing so pm me if you have more questions about it.",

If not, then you should be fine with claiming the credit for a score of 3 or above(as mentioned by other people in the comments). \n\nAlso, AP Human Geography gives credit for GRG 305 if you score over a 3, just so you don't have to stress too much about acing this exam for a 4 or 5. \n\nGRG 305 counts for a Social and Behavioral Science core(there are these things called \"core courses\" in UT, you can find more about it here: [https://catalog.utexas.edu/undergraduate/undergraduate-studies/academic-policies-and-procedures/#corecurriculume](https://catalog.utexas.edu/undergraduate/undergraduate-studies/academic-policies-and-procedures/#corecurriculume) ). Sure, it can be a plus, but I recommend not claiming the course until the very end of your college year when you actually need it. You need to pay money to claim the credits(that's NOT the same as sending your exam scores), and there are tons of classes that accounts for the Social and Behavioral Science core that you can take instead of claiming the credit and paying extra money for unnecessary credit hours.  \nYou are still a freshman in high school, and super cliche it may sound, a score of less than 3 on the AP Biology exam or AP Human Geography exam will not kill you.

I\u2019m sure other grads on here would agree that the gpa padding helps.\n\nIf you don\u2019t plan on taking any other subsequent BIO courses and only need it for grad reqs, then yeah go ahead and do your AP test.\n\nHigh School is easy and you should have fun and do stupid shit that high schoolers do. Of course do good in school as well.\n\nUnless someone else has information to negate this, the university doesn\u2019t really give two shits if you took and passed/failed AP tests. The admissions board is gonna look at your GPA and extra curricular activities and your essays. You could get all 5s on your AP tests but if you have a 3.2 GPA, then you\u2019re doing worse than the kid in all regular classes that gets all As.\n\nI\u2019m honestly baffled that you\u2019re taking AP bio as a freshman in HS.",

I miraculously passed with an A even after getting 0's for some of the quizzes(which still makes me wonder how I passed that class).\n\nIf you never had any coding experience like I did, I assume it would be very, very painstaking. It was seriously harder than my major required courses(which is thankfully not coding). I regret for expecting the course to be a winger, since I also heard the course was \"not that bad\" like some of the comments here when I was trying to register. And no, it's not a winger at all. I could literally understand why cs majors were dying out everyday from taking this course. \n\nGood luck if it is required, possibly look at ratemyprofessors to check out any updates on his and other cs professors for CS 303E.",

Two were kind of rotten but I probably learned more about life and their subjects trying to figure them out then I would\u2019ve if they were straightforward. Looking around at society, I couldn\u2019t favor people not being required to take basics/non-major related courses. We were already taught history and economics and government and English but I\u2019m not seeing that people retained it. When somebody else sucks, I try to look within for the answer, as I usually can\u2019t change them no matter how much I want to but I can control how I interpret it.

I thought that was pretty clear but I guess I'll specifically state that. \n\nI think it's pretty obvious that on average students care about classes that will make observable differences in their lives. This is why students widely enjoy their major concentration classes and the 1 hour music classes, fitness classes, dance classes etc... are all widely praised. \n\nIf the majority of students hated classes and learning like you said it wouldn't make any sense for so many so many students to take an extra 1 hour class onto their workload that is literally all about just learning a new skill.\n\nIt's also why a lot of the times people will say \"Take 'x' professor if you need to learn the subject and take 'y' professor if you want a good grade\", because there's some professors/courses that are harder but will actually teach you a subject that's important for your career or is interesting to you and other professors that make it a easier but you learn less. Like for example, people hate how hard Shabbir for O-chem is but people still often recommend her because she actually makes sure you will know the material, so it depends what your goal is with the class.\n\nA person who is a chemistry or biochemistry major might want to take Shabbir to really have an extremely strong grasp of the subject and fundamentals for their future classes. While if you just want to understand the subject and get by with things with a better grade taking a different professor might make more sense.",

I took the course over the summer with a different professor (the programming assignments are different) so I can't really comment on the workload and such. MIS 302F with Moliski teaches you how to use Excel. Basically, you would purchase an online textbook and it'll teach you A-Z how to use different features of Excel. Not hard at all. When I took the class with Moliski, it was her first/second? time she taught the class, so it was quite disorganized. There were weekly quizzes in which you would be quizzed about lectures (+ some Excel things). I didn't enjoy doing her quizzes and felt like she always wrote the questions at the very last minute, but the textbook grades will easily help you get an A.",

If your classes are not helping you make degree progress or you need additional classes to complete your degree and graduate next semester, then your advisor can probably provide some additional help. If you're planning on graduating and are participating in [senior countdown](https://studentsuccess.utexas.edu/resources/senior-countdown/) then you're guaranteed some form of help to make sure you meet your degree plan requirements and timeline, otherwise there do not seem to be any firm guarantees for courses. But as mentioned, raising concerns about not being able to graduate on time could get some more attention from your advisor during this busy time.\n\nAdditionally, as mentioned earlier, it does not matter how many credit hours you have for registration.

But now that i live walking distance to campus im so much happier! I love UT (and am guilty of spending $200+ on UT merch and football tickets lol). I would say most people i meet who don\u2019t like UT are COLA majors tbh!!! Nothing against them but I think the experiences can vary widely. Most Mccombs people will rate it high because many of them are greek life or in social orgs, so they see UT very differently!\n\nI\u2019m in Moody, and my only advice is 1. don\u2019t be a commuter, it fucking sucks and 2. do EVERYTHING!!! Even if you don\u2019t think you\u2019ll like it. Hang out on campus, go to events, meet the dean, go to concerts on campus, go to parties off campus, go to football games, basketball games, volleyball games. Be a part of something bigger than yourself and take advantage of all the people and cool things around you!!!!",

In my experience taking pre-health courses, there are a lot of entitled students that seem to think that undergrad is a 'formality' because in their minds they should already be in med school. So, instead of putting in work like everyone else, they use dishonest methods to get ahead and stay ahead. A former friend of mine got caught once and they tried to justify their choices with dumb shit like \"well I would have studied more but I had this and that to do\" and \"well this professor was unreasonable anyways so I basically had to cheat to get a good grade\". It's honestly baffling how some people think. \n\nAnother important thing to consider is that people who cheat usually end up doing so habitually. This ruling can help circumvent that. It actually places consequences on people that 'get away with it'. SOO many students lose their chance at grad school, med school, etc. because there are only so many spots available, with some of them unfortunately being taken by scumbags that desperately need a reality check.",

A degree should be treated as property. A university should not have the right to unilaterally appropriate the property of someone who no longer is affiliated with them. This ruling suggests that a degree is a loan by the university. You only get to keep it as long they think you deserve it. Like all other property, this issue should be handled in the courts. Cheaters would still lose their degrees, but there would be a more robust judicial process as opposed to using the opaque university administrative procedures.",

It's as if you cheated well enough then you get to deserve to get away with it, or since everyone else is cheating then it's ok. Even in this post there's this weird resistance to consequences from provable cheating.\n\nAnd yes, it's *especially* disheartening since there's every reason to believe that college cheaters will become professional cheaters. As if we don't have enough problems with unethical professional behavior.",

If the university later feels this was not the case, they, like any other organization, should go to court. For example, if you bought a used car on the pretense that it was in perfect condition and later found out it was not, you must file a civil case. You are not allowed to simply return the car and take your money back. Universities should have an avenue to rescind degrees awarded based on dishonesty, but they cannot be the judge and the executioner. For example, what if in the future, universities begin to rescind degrees based on the political stance of the individual? They could claim that this violated a requirement for the degree and take it back unilaterally. The individual would have no remedy but to appeal using the universities internal system, which would be heavily biased in the universities favor. I think this sets a dangerous precedent.",

A cheater in a given class could be required to prove knowledge level or retake the class.   Or the school can refund costs to student.   The school needs some \u201cteeth\u201d around this because they have requirements for admission as a way of protecting their desirability for incoming students, but it should not be completely all are nothing if a student is guilty of infractions in one or more classes out of 40 or more classes taken.  Like instead of taking the degree away, it gets marked with a provisional status that remains until the student proves a level of knowledge in the given subject matter in question. \n\nI realize some students cheat as a matter of course, and proof of one case COULD indicate cheating in other cases to be likely.   But taking a hard line is equally wrong when it is not known, only suspected, that cheating occurred. \n\nThis above is all from a deeply passionate standpoint against cheating.   I am heartbroken by how rampant cheating was in high schools while my child attended, and was very very hard for my child too, seeing people cheating left and right.

You're the one who confused it with a criminal court.\n\nThe universities have been giving their students \"due process\" for decades now, and it's generally not been run like the criminal courts.  \"Innocent until proven guilty\" is not how they usually do it, and this has been especially clear with Title IX cases regarding things such as sexual assault -- a sexual assault is claimed, but the justice system doesn't have enough evidence to show guilt \"beyond a reasonable doubt\" and so no criminal charges are pursued, but the university has enough to support the \"preponderance of evidence\" or the \"clear and convincing evidence\" standard and so *they* handle it.  Sure, there may be hearings, but it's not like a criminal trial where everybody makes their case to a jury -- instead, maybe the accused can convince the accusors (well, the university) that they're wrong.\n\nBut \"innocent until proven guilty\" is a criminal thing, and [it's not even an accurate description of that](https://www.lawinfo.com/resources/criminal-defense/is-the-presumption-of-innocence-in-the-consti.html) -- instead, it's a description of things like the right to remain silent or the right to a trial by a jury of your peers -- things that probably don't exist in a university hearing.   It's still due process, but the standards are different than a criminal trial.\n\n> If that was the case in our society, cancel culture wouldn't be as prevalent, as an example.\n\nThat's quite a segue!",

I have this one saved because it is my favorite:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n  \nCampus Watch: Below is a  \nsummary of campus criminal activity reported to or observed by The University  \nof Texas At Austin Police Department Patrol Officers between 10/30/17 and  \n11/06/17.\u00a0  \n\u00a0Poke Bowl Restaurant\u00a02828 Guadalupe Street  \n\u00a0  \nDriving While Intoxicated/Resisting Arrest or Detention:Two  \nUTPD officers on patrol in the area of the 2900 block of Rio Grande met in a  \nparking lot to discuss an earlier event. While conversing, they heard the sound  \nof tires squealing followed by a loud crash. They quickly responded and  \nobserved that a vehicle had crashed through the front of the Poke Bowl  \nRestaurant and came to rest in the bathroom. Officers observed that the vehicle  \nwas still occupied and the driver (a UT Student) was attempting to put the  \nvehicle in reverse and leave the scene. Officers ordered the suspect to get out  \nof the car but she persisted in her attempt to leave the scene. However, the  \nstructure of the restaurant had collapsed around the car preventing it from  \nmoving. The debris also prevented the doors from opening. One officer used his  \nbaton to break out a window to allow the driver to exit the vehicle. While the  \nwindow was successfully opened, it proved to precarious to have the driver exit  \nthrough it. Another officer, assisted by a security guard, at the risk of their  \nown safety, moved debris from the passenger side of the vehicle and was able to  \nsafely extract the driver. Officers summoned EMS and the driver was found to  \nhave only minor injuries. Upon interacting with the driver, the officers  \nquickly formed the belief that she may have been intoxicated. The driver argued  \nwith officers and demanded an immediate breathalyzer (it doesn\u2019t work that  \nway). The officers attempted to explain to the driver that APD would be  \nresponding as well since the crash occurred in their primary jurisdiction. The  \ndriver explained that she was UT affiliated and as a result would only interact  \nwith UTPD. The officers attempted to explain that they, in fact, were UTPD.  \nShortly thereafter, the driver attempted to snatch her ID from the officer\u2019s  \nhand. Given her aggressive behavior and the evidence that she was intoxicated,  \nofficers made the decision to take her into custody. When officers attempted to  \nplace the suspect into handcuffs, she violently pulled away and explained (and  \nthis is a direct quote) \u201cI\u2019m a UT Student! You can\u2019t arrest me!\u201d Officers asked  \nthe suspect if her intention was to fight the police to which she replied  \n\u201cyeah!\u201d Officers were able to safely place her in handcuffs before escorting  \nher to the police car \u2013 without a use of force. However, once inside the car,  \nthe suspect began to kick at the windows and doors of the vehicle. Officers  \nrestrained her in the back seat and transported her to Travis County Central  \nBooking. Upon arrival, Deputies placed her into the restraint chair and wheeled  \nher into isolation due to her violent behavior. Occurred on 11/6/17 at 2:22 am.",

It might not feel like it at the time, but college, and this time in your late teens/early 20's, is full of growth and learning who you are.

As great as Stanford and Harvard is, there\u2019s a lot of pros and cons to weigh out and it can be really tough. I had the option of either being a Terry or going to UC Berkley and I ended up landing on UT as a Terry because of financial reasons. The main thing to keep in mind that as a pre med here at UT, I believe that you will have an amazing time here with copious amounts of opportunities at your door especially since you\u2019re a Terry. It doesn\u2019t really matter where you go if you\u2019re pre med it\u2019s all about what you do with your time and resources are VERY available to you here and connections run very deep here at UT as well. As a pre med here I have gain a variety of different clinical opportunities, shadowing, research, volunteer, etc. pretty much everything you need. AND organizations such as The Natural Science Council can really get you to stand out as an applicant when applying to medical school seeing as you can make real tangible changes to your community. \n\nAt the end of the day it\u2019s up to you on where you go but I have met many terrys that have chosen both routes (Stanford/Harvard over Terry, or Terry over Stanford) and they are both AMAZING options. The one VERY important thing too is MONEY! As a terry you not only graduate with $0 in debt (which helps a lot considering you\u2019re going to be graduating medical school with  >$100,000) BUT you are practically getting PAID to go to school. You don\u2019t have to worry about rent for your apartment and whether or not you can leisurely spend without having to worry about financial burdens. Sorry for the long message but I HIGHLY recommend taking Terry if you are worried at all about financials. It\u2019s SUCH a weight off your shoulders\n\nHope that helped :)",

UT provided me 90% of these experiences that got me there, but it was a LOT of work I had to do. With the Terry scholarship, you will definitely have an easier time to focus on these opportunities available and prepare yourself for either med school or grad school. \n\nI agree that the name of Stanford/Harvard is significant, but so is being in debt. I am thankful I am debt free. I am glad my major allows me to go to grad school basically for free. I think it is a lot less of a burden than what my friends have. \n\nI think you have to weigh whether you want to be in a better financial state after your bachelors  or if you believe the prestige will matter more.",

You'll more than likely be making about the same as someone who went to UT, but don't have as much to take home at the end of the day.

        "body": "Hi, I was in your EXACT situation. I got accepted into Harvard and a couple of other ivys and applied to UT as a Bio major pursuing pre-med and got the Terry Scholarship.\n\nI ended up picking UT and am now a 3rd year and don't regret it whatsoever. Trust me I completely understand the appeal and benefits of the connections you get from going to an Ivy; I also do think there is a benefit to having that name on your medical school application.\n\nHowever, at the end of the day, UT has an insane amount of resources because there is such a large undergraduate body and it really comes down to however much YOU put into using those resources. It's easier to switch majors early on, and you can still pursue pre-med if you want (I know a History major, philosophy major, business major who are all pre-med). It can be more difficult to switch at UT; I also have friends at Stanford and can attest to the fact that they do have unique flexibility with their curriculum; however, I also think that if you are wanting to explore other career paths you can still do that at UT while just hanging with bio temporarily and taking the intro classes for whatever you are interested in because those are open for anyone.\n\nAs far as having connections, Terry has a portal that lists out graduated Terrys and their jobs and where they are located, etc. Being in Terry is really like being in a family and I have reached out to doctors, engineers, marketing, entrepreneurs, etc. graduates and they can give you advice or mentorship and some will let you shadow them. (There is this one Terry who is a flight surgeon at NASA- it's crazy).\n\n(example of a program offered: I am in Bridging Disciplines Program and get to have a certificate different from my degree in something that I am passionate about. There are many other programs out there too where you can get credit as part of your degree and it can be very customizable although I admit UT majors are likely more stringent than an Ivy which is why I did BSA Bio degree and I have been able to take wayyyyy more classes that I actually care about)\n\nAlso, I was able to get involved in research here at UT (my freshman year I did through FRI and did some gut microbiome stuff), but now I'm in a Neuroscience lab; and I say this because there are SO many research opportunities if you just keep going to the mixers and reaching out to different labs for openings. At Ivys my friends have said how competitive/few spots there are for those kinds of things just because there are so many students vying for them. UT has a humungo endowment so there is quite a bit of research happening on campus.\n\nI can't speak on how close Stanford and Harvards medical school is with undergrad, but Dell medical school is an up-and-coming really great medical school and they're pretty close to campus, so there are many opportunities to move your way up in the ranks and really get to know the staff and doctors there (and to get a bunch of volunteer hours). And obviously, the Ivys have better medical schools, but Dell med school will also be way cheaper than an Ivy\n\nAnd so we've arrived at cost. Debt was something I didn't think was worth for the Ivy League name initially; now that I have been at UT (low-key I came dragging my feet at first because Ivy had always been the dream), I am absolutely positive it was the right decision for me. My parents weren't in a place where they could assist me whatsoever and I knew I would also have medical school debt. Obviously, if you decide to become a doctor, after residency (if you manage money right and live below your means) you'll be able to pay it back even if you go into debt, but Terry really removes such a heavy burden from your shoulders throughout college and into medical school since that gap will be so much smaller. The burden will really be relieved by Terry *especially* if you decide you don't want to be a doctor and end up going down a career path that doesn't pay as well (which I am glad you are considering outside options because there are so many incredible things out there to consider).\n\nAlso, something to consider is that not having to worry about paying rent or having a job means that you have more chances to take leadership roles, volunteer, and all of the extracurriculars that will help you get into a better medical school. And what medical/grad school you go to will matter way more than what undergrad you go to.\n\nI think if you really want to be a doctor, you will be regardless of what school you go to because you will care about pursuing that and finding things you care about and finding doctors to shadow and be able to have connections with alumni etc etc etc. UT offers way more than I realized they did before I came here and the Terry family is awesome; literally incredible when it comes to having immediate friends around you when you first get to UT and like I mentioned before all of the incredible alumni who are all over the place.\n\nUT was the right decision for me especially because money was an issue and paying for flights and all of the living expenses wouldn't have been done easily. I have still been pushed and challenged by my professors here and in the classes (random side note: I still loathe Texas weather, but at least the campus is pretty). I think whichever one you end up picking you will make it work regardless; graduating college debt free is a really great start into the world once you graduate, but I know this is a huge decision and there are a lot of factors and there is clout with going to an Ivy but IMO I don't think the clout is worth 60K of debt since UT still has opportunities for you to have some room with your degree and still has great things pre-meds can do near campus.\n\nFeel free to message me if you have more questions or anything and congrats on making it to this crossroads!!",

        "body": "Hi! I'm the Core & Flags advisor, housed out of the Vick Center. The Skills & Experience Flags are part of our general education requirements, and are unique to UT Austin. There are six of them, each designed to provide students with a certain Skill or Experience that will be of use throughout their degree & career: Cultural Diversity in the US, Ethics, Global Cultures, Independent Inquiry, Quantitative Reasoning, and Writing. \n\nFlags help students build competencies that will continue to serve you even as fields and industries change and adapt. The jobs available ten or fifteen years ago may look totally different than the ones you're currently training for, but you'll still need to know how to communicate effectively, how to think and reason on your own, and how to interact with people different from you. For example, I for sure didn't have the chance to take a \"posting on reddit\" course when I was in college, but the writing skills I learned all those years ago are still of use!\n\nMost degree plans have the Flags built-in, and our goal is that you'll be able to fulfill all your Flags organically throughout your time at UT without having to hunt for them. Not every degree plan is at that point yet, but you can also fulfill your Flags with Core courses, electives, and study abroad courses too. A single course can grant you up to three Flags, and they overlap with all other major, minor, certificate, and general education requirements. \n\nAt orientation, you'll have a chance to learn more about Core & Flags from your college advising staff. If you still have questions afterwards, or want to plan ahead to get all your Flags covered, you can make an appointment at the Vick Center and talk to me and my fellow advisors! \n\nFor detailed information about Flags, you can check out the Center for the Skills & Experience Flags [website](https://ugs.utexas.edu/flags/students), which has a whole student toolkit available. My contact information and appointment booking is available there as well, if any currently enrolled students want to chat 1x1 about Core or Flags! I'm also happy to answer any follow up questions here :)\n\nHook 'em!",

Maybe this is just my personal preference but I would maybe try to balance out your classes so you have \\~2 classes MTWTh instead of clustering them MWF. This would allow for more balanced, sustainable studying everyday rather than cramming it on the days you have off. Enjoying and finding time for eating/exercising/sleeping everyday is also important, which is why I recommend spreading it out throughout the week and having more gaps. Volunteering is typically pretty flexible and can be done in the evenings/mornings depending on classes.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAgain this is just my personal preference because I like studying during the day everyday.

Pre-med, in my opinion, is not too difficult to balance if you have a good routine. Once you develop a routine, it is absolutely manageable. \n\nEverything is about how much time you devote to each one of your task and how much you prioritize different aspects of your college experience.  I will say that if you coasted through high school without doing any self-studying ever, it will be an adjustment for you. However, if you self-studied in high school and made a habit of learning and reading the textbook on your own, then you will be more than well equipped to balance school and a social life.   \n\n\nIt's also good to come in with a mindset of not comparing yourself to others. It seems like you already have that mindset when you wrote how everyone is different. You will meet people who have amazing grades and amazing social life who seem to have it all together but deep down they are struggling. The opposite also applies. Every piece of advice you need to take with a grain of salt. Long story short, if you work at creating a routine for yourself, then it is definitely possible to have a good balance. Congrats on getting into UT!",

Like most people said u won\u2019t get access to the Mccombs resources such as recruit Mccombs etc but u can still succeed as an Econ major. On the topic of transferring to Mccombs u can definitely try to internal transfer after your first year just make sure to get involved in business related orgs and get a 4.0 or close to a 4.0.",

If you're looking to join the tech scene at FAANG, Tesla, etc, then UT may be the better choice. If you want to end up in Fin-tech working on the east coast, then maybe Cornell is the better option. Idk the exact strengths of each program, you'll need to find that out for yourself. Talk to both CS departments about which companies have strong recruiting relationships with the university. If you notice a pattern of FAANG/international companies at one university vs smaller/regional firms at the other university, your choice is clear. \n\nAs a general rule, don't pick a university for the marginal prestige of the parent institution. Once you get up to the top 50 universities in the US, the prestige differences are pretty minimal as most major companies recruit across the board. Unless you're trying to get into venture capital or something extremely selective, the reputation differences between universities don't matter nearly as much as the reputation of the academic department you seek to join.\n\nI'm in engineering, not quite CS, but similar enough in terms of the career recruitment process. Even then, I've heard UT has a very good CS program, notably because of the many connections between the CS department and major employers.

I'm from Michigan (came to UT to escape the cold) and I actually have family in New York and know how to live in it. Your biggest difference is going to be in layering. You'll wear a standard outfit as a base (jeans/sweats/leggings, light shirt) and then go from there. Put a baggier pair of pants on first (tuck these into your boots or make sure they have fitted ankles), then a sweater and a scarf. Maybe another, even larger, sweater on top of that if you have it. Then do the hat and gloves. Winter coat/jacket comes last, and it needs to have a hood and pockets. The most important thing here is that the air pockets created by your clothes are what keeps you warm, not the clothes themselves. Six layers of clothing won't do you any good if there aren't gaps in between those layers for your body heat to get and keep warm.\n\nIf you do end up choosing Cornell, you'll get used to the cold, and people will be more than willing to help if you ask.",

You'll end up walking into the top of the 'first' deck. You can then walk down and get onto the field. It was an open gate.\n\nI did this a few times in daytime and nighttime before I got caught. Cops pretty much gave a \"Don't do it again\". I said \"Oh I thought we could come down because of the open gate\". \n\nSo long as you don't bring spraypaint or anything to deface the field, you can get away with it but be put on a list of people who have gone in there without authorization before.\n\nEdit: I was asked if I had spraypaint because it was a Friday and I was wearing Cougar Red.

I went down there as part of a tour for a class (I believe it was Building Environmental Systems which is all about HVAC, electrical, and insulation, for the relevance). \n\nIn the basement, the floor slopes slowly up towards the sides of the building, meaning the ceiling gets lower and it gets darker as you get closer to the edges. On at least two of the walls, there is an entrance that's pitch black inside and about 3 or 4 feet tall. There's a bunch of wires and smaller pipes coming out of the tunnel, so you'd have to crouch quite a bit to maneuver through it. The guy giving the tour advised strongly against going inside, because one of the pipes in the tunnel carries high pressure steam. He said if there's even a small leak in the steam pipe and you walk past it, you'll get third-degree burns before you can even react. \n\nIt was a few years ago, so I may be misremembering some details.",

We can confirm the course was designed and measured to be 3.1011 miles for the 5K and 6.2465 for the 10K. However, several factors make it difficult for the distance to measure the same for all runners depending on the varying tracking devices, how wide or narrow runners take their turns at intersections, if runners run on the sidewalk at any point, and in some instances even signal on the tracking device could be interrupted along the way causing the discrepancy, etc. \n\nIt is quite difficult for anyone to run the course exactly the same way it was measured. The route is planned and measured for wide turns at intersections and never running on sidewalks.  Having said all of this and while our team takes multiple measurements when mapping and running the course, we also want to be transparent about the fact that the Longhorn Run is not a USATF certified course. \n\nIf you have any other questions, we're always available! \n\nWe hope to see you next year and congratulations on your race! \n\nBest,\n\nLonghorn Run Team",

You may be eligible for compensation as a member of the class action suit.\n\nThis is a summary of the case involving Plaintiff Romulo Torres and Defendants Botanic Tonics, LLC; 7-Eleven, Inc.; and Does 1 through 10:\n\n1. Plaintiff Romulo Torres, on behalf of himself and others similarly situated, brings a class action lawsuit against Botanic Tonics, 7-Eleven, and unidentified defendants, alleging false advertising and misrepresentation of the product \"Feel Free Wellness Tonic,\" as well as failure to warn about its dangerous side effects.\n2. Botanic Tonics advertised \"Feel Free\" as a safe, sober, and healthy alternative to alcohol, targeting individuals battling addiction and college students.\n3. The company claimed that \"Feel Free\" was a kava-based drink, safe, healthy, and not addictive, with no side effects.\n4. Contrary to the marketing claims, \"Feel Free\" contains kratom, an plant with opioid properties with addiction risks and potential side effects similar to controlled narcotics.\n5. Kratom can cause moderate to severe side effects, including addiction, withdrawal, and various health issues.\n6. Botanic Tonics manipulated the formula of \"Feel Free\" to magnify the effects of kratom and did not disclose the presence or concentration of kratom or the potential side effects.\n7. Plaintiff Romulo Torres, a recovering alcoholic, tried \"Feel Free\" after seeing targeted ads and became addicted, eventually relapsing to alcohol use.\n8. Torres experienced severe symptoms due to \"Feel Free,\" requiring medical detox and readmission to a rehabilitation facility, resulting in job loss and severe impacts on his family life.\n9. The plaintiff's story is not unique, and many others have been victims of Botanic Tonics' targeted and misleading advertising.\n10. 7-Eleven's partnership with Botanic Tonics helped expand the market for \"Feel Free,\" increasing the scope of the product's effect on public health.\n11. The plaintiff asserts claims under California Unfair Competition Law, California False Advertising Law, common law fraud, breach of the implied warranty of merchantability, and unjust enrichment.\n12. The plaintiff seeks restitution, disgorgement, equitable relief, costs and expenses of litigation including attorneys' fees, punitive damages, and any additional relief deemed appropriate and just by the court.\n\nLegal Contacts:\n\nARNS DAVIS LAW\n\n515 Folsom St., 3rd Floor\nSan Francisco, CA 94109\n\nTel: (415) 495-7800\nFax: (415) 495-7888\n\nRobert S.

Not really much an issue unless you have an addictive personality.\n\nThat said, I\u2019m actually more worried that fentanyl could be an issue here. Some kratom suppliers have found that they have upstream adulteration issues with fentanyl lately. This would be perfectly consistent with stories of people talking about being rapidly addicted.\n\nKava kava itself has a phenomenon of reverse tolerance. The more and longer you drink, the less and less you need.

It\u2019s easy not to think about now because you wouldn\u2019t have to pay, but you\u2019ll almost certainly regret it 10 years from now. \n\nTake the debt free path. TCU is still a good school. And CS has a lot of opportunity. You could also switch your major at TCU if you prefer economics. It\u2019s really easy to do. Especially transferring out of engineering instead of to.",

My degree isn't as prestigious as it could have been but I wouldn't trade my years in Austin for literally anything.

I doubled in ECE / math and engineers are usually pretty impressed by the math part, so I think you're good with a math major + certificate, and you can always grind CS on the side. you'll also notice many parallels between classes like discrete math and number theory to algorithms, linear algebra and probability to machine learning, and stochastic processes to modeling real world systems. good luck!",
