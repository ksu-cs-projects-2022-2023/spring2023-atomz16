My sincere advice:\n\n- When not in class, do the assigned work. If you run into something that stumps you, do your best and \u2026\n\n- When in class, ask fucking questions. Especially about stuff you didn\u2019t understand on your homework. \n\n- As a summer class with longer lectures, be sure to bring some caffeine. The room will be warm, the day long, the material dry. You\u2019re in terrible danger of sleep agent poisoning. When you get a break, go outside and stretch and take a deep breath. *Believe it or not, WVU, (and I don\u2019t think you do) being alert and paying attention in class can lead to better grades. The other side of that coin is that dozing off, being distracted, and skipping class, can lead to worse grades.* Not really groundbreaking shit, as assholes have been yelling that at me since the late 1970s. And I can\u2019t say I\u2019ve done any valid research myself but it seemed to me when I taught at Ohio State that my best grades on tests went to students who paid attention in class, asked lots of questions, and turned in all their homework. (Never gave an F; Russian language is intimidating enough that anyone not willing to put in a serious effort dropped the class in the first week.)\n\nNot trying to be an asshole to OP here, but yeah. Those few rules should get you through most undergraduate classes just fine. After the whole K-12 experience or its equivalent, that should already be clear. There will be some classes you can slip by without doing homework, without paying attention in class, and without really interacting in any way. For most of us, math ain\u2019t it. \n\nAlso, see if Papajohn\u2019s still got the weekly study group in the summer. If so, stop in. Sure it\u2019s more geared to 155/156. You can polish up those skills, and maybe pick his brain too.",

All the events in each are cool and it comes down to personal preference. Even though I didn't think it was amazing, I would 100% recommend going on one of them just so you can start socializing with people from different areas.

Which means they packed up tents every day or two, carried it through the area, and set it up again. The Odyssey one I went on had a \"base camp\" where we set up tents for the whole time. Each day, we went to different areas to do different activities. The different trips have a pretty good overlap in the activities they do. The main difference that I can tell between the Odyssey and Explore is that Explore would hike a lot while Odyssey had \"down time\" at camp during that period. We also had an actual bath house/bathroom and I don't think they actually showered at Explore.\n\n\nFrom what I remember, each day in the Odyssey one, we had a main activity. I remeber we did rock climbing the first day. Another was a trip to Canaan Valley. We did white water rafting on another day with a trip to the small town nearby. We also did some hiking at Cooper's Rock. My favorite day was when we went to some jungle gym area. We broke out into groups of 4 or 5 and did a bunch of obstacle course stuff with them.\n\n\nI didn't know anyone who went on the Quest one, so I can't talk about what that one did.\n\n\nHonestly, the Explore one is probably better for socializing and meeting people. It has a smaller group size and it's much easier to form relationships in that vs the one I did that had like 20 people.\n\n\nAlso, the food is horrible. So you might want to bring some protein bars/granola. I ate more canned chicken then I ever wanted to in my entire life during that trip lol.",

The petition text itself goes into some very brief details and links to a very extensive survey the GPSS conducted amongst graduate students, which included questions specifically about this fee and it's potential impacts. \n\nHowever, as this is a new campaign that we only started this past week we are currently working on getting articles published to address this issue in detail and call for folks support.\n\nJust seems silly not to meme and seek out the already convinced in the mean time.",

Maintenance can be a little slow but otherwise we've really enjoyed the new place immensely and will probably be staying here until I'm done with my program. Like I can't think of any other negatives we've faced since moving in January.\n\nThe apartments are really quiet and spacious. I rarely hear my neighbors at all (the quiet was a huge draw since where we'd been living had serious noise issues). I asked the woman giving us the tour what the deal was with Campus View and she said most residents are grad students, med students, working professionals, and retirees. My neighbour across the street is retired, and neighbors on both sides of me are post-grad. She also said these apartments are usually too expensive for undergrads, which is why they rarely rent (utilities aren't included). \n\nIt's worth noting they have two locations, though. I live near the medical campus, and those apartments are more expensive (but also walkable to the PRT). Their apartments at Grove Park are newer and MUCH cheaper, but they're pretty far out and you can't get to them without a car. We almost took one there but it was just a bit too remote so we opted for more in-town. The super cheap ones you're seeing are probably the Grove Park apartments. They're really nice, though. The woman giving the tour told us that out there it's mostly families and people who work at the prison (it's nearby) and that WVU students usually go for the Med Campus apartments for convenience.\n\nOverall though, I highly recommend Campus View. They've been easy to work with and the apartment is fantastic.",

I can\u2019t speak as much to STEM, but I did EXCEL as a humanities student and it has been so beneficial to my grad school experience, if not just for the knowledge of how to design and complete a research project under a faculty mentor.

For aero kids, there's design build fly which scratch builds rc planes, microgravity which gets to go on the vomit comet zero g plane, and rocketry. On the mechanical side, there's EcoCAR, Formula SAE, and Baja, which are all automotive focused. \n\nDefinitely ask about the design teams, cause I was an ME major and did EcoCAR so I only know generally what other groups do.

My only advice is to really take independent time to study your aero concepts as the early aero classes haven't been rigorous enough to build a robust foundation, in my opinion. Though, it's a blessing and a curse since the whole dual program itself is difficult and time consuming. I'm a senior dual btw.\nAs others have said, there's a lot of design team opportunities here. Plus your two senior capstones will also be design-team orientated. There's also lots of undergraduate research opportunities. \nWhen I was in highschool, my main motivator for choosing wvu was its affordability.

Since you'll be coming to WV, you have to consider the state as a whole as well - while there's a pretty great DIY scene in Morgantown for the arts (primarily music), overall as a state, there are little opportunities to work in the music industry. \n\nLike the other poster commented, I would heavily consider if the OOS tuition is a beneficial ROI for you. I would also consider the Reed College of Media as an option - they have a lot of multidisciplinary majors that can be applied fairly broadly, and have pretty great job placement within the college. \n\nIf you network a bunch and become active on campus, you have a decent shot of working in the industry if you're willing to move/make the financial sacrifice to pursue music industry as a career. I have a friend that did the music industry program who now works in Nashville, but she was heavily involved during undergrad and worked incredibly hard to network her way to that position",

Are you in a situation where you can afford better housing? Generally speaking, I would recommend Towers, or Oakland for Evansdale, and Boreman and Stalnaker for Downtown. Oakland is a little out of the way but theres plenty of amenities the bathrooms are shared but they are pod style meaning only 1 person can use it at a time. Towers has community bathrooms so its shared but the room size is solid and the amenities are good. (Except the heat/AC sometimes cuz they're trash). Stalnaker is downtown so it's close to a lot of stuff and the bathrooms are shared but only between a couple of rooms. (You'll have to climb Mt. Olympus to access the dorm though) And boreman has community bathrooms and suite bathrooms but youd have to get a suite for that :/. All in all, I recommend Oakland or Stalnaker if possible. If you want to find out more go to the wvu housing website and browse through the dorms. (Probably should've said that first...)",

Summit is like right beside honors and is pretty similar though. Summit has a buffet style place to get food and a grab-and-go sub place on the bottom floor if you\u2019re feeling to lazy to hike to the lair on some days.\n\nIf your classes are mostly Evansdale pick an Evansdale dorm. You don\u2019t want to have to rely on the PRT to reach the majority of your classes if possible. If you\u2019re half and half I\u2019d lean towards a downtown dorm since it\u2019s easier to get to the lair/high street for general food and social activities. \n\nAs far as general tips for living alone, most other freshman are in the same situation as you so don\u2019t freak out too much. Just use common sense and try to get along with your roommate, talk to them and don\u2019t feel scared to suggest sharing each other\u2019s routines/plans so the room can be split fairly. Be open to trying new things, and if something is making your life hard make a real effort to fix it.",

It was like that. \n\nWhat I wanted to ask but never got the chance, was which side was opposed to accessible higher education.

Anything critically important like a laptop or documents should probably be taken with them if they\u2019re on break.\n\nThere is parking which can be purchased through transportation.wvu. The best parking spot I know of for Lincoln hall is law school hill which is about a 5 minute walk from Lincoln. Cars do have to be moved for home football games and put back by the following Monday (which is incredibly annoying) but it\u2019s only for football season, and the location where cars are temporarily moved to is a day lot right behind towers which is right across the street from Lincoln. \n\nIf your question is \u201cdo they need a car to get around Morgantown/to classes?\u201d then no, they don\u2019t need one. The PRT, buses, and walking shoes are all they need. This year, the honors college has done a couple ski/snowboarding trips for those interested.\n\nI recommend the unlimited dining plan just because it comes with dining dollars which can be spent at university owned restaurants and grab-n-go locations. The dining halls can be pretty lackluster if not barren at times, so having dining dollars is a lifesaver. Also, having the unlimited plan means they\u2019re not forced to eat whatever garbage is in the dining hall after swiping in, they can just walk out without worrying that they lost one of their meals for the week.\n\nOne last thing you didn\u2019t ask about, but I will recommend: absolutely encourage them to go on an adventure trip. Everyone that I know of who went on an adventure trip had a great time and met lots of friends. Everyone from my adventure trip talks and hangs out with each other. It\u2019s a super valuable experience going into WVU.",

        "body": "Lincoln is nice, however there\u2019s no real \u201clocking\u201d storage.  The best thing to do would be to take valuables home, don\u2019t bring them, or have a laptop you wouldn\u2019t \u201cmind\u201d replacing. Most people take their valuables home, well, because they want them at home. Also, don\u2019t buy the mini fridge BS. You\u2019re allowed to bring a fridge or a microwave. My roommate brought the fridge, I brought a microwave. Technically against the rules, but I was never caught and chucked it in a box in my closet over breaks when they do room checks (they aren\u2019t allowed to open closets or go though personal items, only allowed to \u201cinspect\u201d what\u2019s in plain view). \n\nGet a camera, I can help you connect it to the Wi-Fi if needed, but I was robbed freshman year in Lincoln by a member of the maintenance staff and I caught them on camera. I\u2019ve had cameras at my college houses since. \n\nI will stress though theft is rare, especially at Lincoln (the doors auto lock like a hotel, and you use your ID to get into your room, no keys). Use common sense, don\u2019t leave a Rolex on your desk. \n\nDon\u2019t bring a car freshman year unless they need it to come home. Parking is a nightmare, the busses pick up right at towers across the street, and honestly a car is too much of a distraction to worry about (your kid will always be giving rides once their friends find out they have a car, you don\u2019t want that insurance liability). You would need to move it to a paid lot on game day, again a major pain in the ass (I have my own opinions on parking here, but it\u2019s expensive and fills up quick). \n\nFood, get them the Go 13 and maybe Venmo them a few bucks if they run out of swipes. The unlimited is unnecessary, and isn\u2019t worth the price bump.  The food isn\u2019t great, but I never had it make me sick either. I thought it was acceptable for what it was.",

Food, as you live 3 hours away and your child will need 21 meals per week you don't want to do anything less as 13 meals even with Dining Dollars will not be enough. My suggestion would be to do the unlimited Dining Plan and see how your child does because you could then change it for the spring semester and go less if you or they feel that you are wasting money. My child does not have a problem with the food on campus. Depends on location and expectations. It's normal campus, college food. It is not home cook meals so if you go in with that expectation everything will be fine.",

Having to manage that many more keys probably isn't in WVU's interest.\n\nParking - they are being serious when they say \"don't bring your car.\" Even though enrollment has dropped, it's still not easy to get a yearly permit, especially one in a lot where your student won't have to constantly move their car for events. If they want to go snowboarding, visit them for a weekend and take them yourself, or see if they can befriend some other snowboarders with vehicles.\n\nFood - I can't speak since I was early-mid 00s and the food was decent, but all I've seen since Sodexo took over is the quality of the food is awful. I've eaten at the Mountainlair since and I can't say the eateries outside of Chick-fil-a are decent. There are two ways to think about it: 1) if they have unlimited, then they can drop in and see what's on the menu whenever and not lose a meal, but you're going to be paying a lot for times they won't want to touch the food and 2) there are several fast food and sit-down eateries within walking distance from Lincoln, and you could load up their Mountie Bounty (or whatever it is these days) to eat at those places, or just give them an allowance each week for food.\n\nDefinitely see if they can get the microfridge. Having that minifridge and microwave is very handy, plus it offsets the need to eat crappy Sodexo food with microwaveable food!",

When you have to move the car for game days they actually supply a closer, more convenient spot. The only issue is that law hill is a 10-15 minute walk all uphill so get your cardio in now. \n\nUnlimited meal plan is also the best option due to reasons mentioned above and the fact that the increase in dining dollars is more than the extra cost of the plan compared to the go 13, Lyons den was my life saver freshman year",

I believe every Thursday or Wednesday for night skiing at Wisp, and every Saturday for all day skiing at Timberline. The prices for these trips are extremely good deals sense it includes the ride to the resort and the ticket. They also rent skis and snowboards at really low prices but the equipment it not ground breaking. Still worth it at the low price they set. Look into Adventure WV because they do all kinds of other outdoor programs. I\u2019m going to a kayaking roll class this Thursday (which is free).",

It did put me below the math class I was supposed to start with for my major, but many people end up in this situation. I would recommend not retaking it again and accept the results. I had a buddy who retook it again and studied hard to place in a higher math class only to fail it. I didn\u2019t retake the test and never failed a math class.

The building is also old and needs to be redone. Dorms like Lincoln, Oakland, Stalnaker, and Seneca are definitely nicer.\n\nBUT. Boreman is not a terrible place to live. The suite style bathrooms in Boreman South are nice if you don't want a communal hall bathroom (I know some other halls have this too). The entries in Boardman South are also each independent and require your student id to get in, but do not go by a front desk. This is nice to avoid having to sing in guests, or interact with the front desk/RAs - there is an RA room in each entry, but that's better than the front office.\n\nBoreman is also in a great location. Right next to the mountainlair and high street (downtown Morgantown: clubs, restaurants, etc.), and not on top of the hill like Dadisman/Stalnaker. It's also closer to downtown classes, which is where most classes are unless you are engineering, fine arts, agricultural sciences. I was able to make it to a 9:30 class several times last year after waking up at 9:15. I was able to go back to my room between classes even when I didn't have much time, and I didn't have to take the prt or a bus each time I went downtown for anything.\n\nI know people who have lived in each of the residence halls, and the MAJORITY of people are fine with the hall they choose, get used to living there, and make it work with whatever they have. Short of getting a bad roommate, you will probably be fine, and during the first month of living there, spots open up in all the halls as people move around, and the Residence Life Supervisors (new name for Residence Hall Coordinator) are usually pretty accommodating of students who wish to move during that time - at least the last couple years they have been.\n\nWVU has a list of all the amenities for each residence hall, so once you get your housing assignment I would look into that and go to the website/social media accounts for your hall.",

He either forgot to inform his parent, his parent chose poorly, or he had to register when he got back. I'm not sure exactly what happened but that's how he wound up in Dadisman.  \n\nWhen you want to live close to campus, you couldn't get much better than Stalnaker anyway, but I think at the time it wasn't available to freshmen.\n\nThey should really just do an overhaul of both, but as long as people continue to tough it out for a year they're not going to bother",

The GPA's needed vary year to year based on how many Direct Admit students we bring in and how competitive the class is. Historically, usually a 3.5 GPA is needed to be considered, but last year we admitted a student with a 3.45 GPA so it can dip below periodically. There is no GPA I can guarantee though. Slots also vary depending on how many Direct Admit students we bring in, but what doesn't change is that we admit 136 students into the program after the freshman year for the sophomore year. Again, a portion of those seats will be Direct Admit students. \u201c",

        "body": "Not really. It used to be a major party school, but the university and the police have cracked down on it during the past 5 or so years. Freshman year, the clubs and bars were packed with a line around the building, house parties occured all throughout Morgantown and it was easy to find one, frat row always had something going on, the legendary Tent City, I'm Schmacked videos, and, of course, couch burnings. People would party every single day of the week, no matter if it was a Monday or a Saturday.\n\nThings changed over the course of my 6 year tenure there. They tore down several blocks of housing in one of the biggest party/street riot areas so that put a damper on that with a good chunk of the \"party houses\" being gone. Greek Life was completely revamped and neutered after that kid died my sophomore year so you pretty much had to know someone in a frat or be in a frat/sorority to get into Greek events. I stopped paying attention to the Greek Life scene in maybe 2016, but I've heard it's only gotten worse with almost all of the frats disaffiliating. House parties got harder to find and you pretty much had to know the right people, even then, the police would come and shut the party down pretty quickly. My last 4 years there, I mostly went to bars and clubs because those were the only places where I was guaranteed to be able to party without disruptions. Even then, I could tell that less people were going out because the bars weren't very packed and the lines weren't wrapped around the building like they used to. I was able to get in with no problem. \n\nI think WVU has worked really really hard to try to shed their party school image. Even when it was considered a party school, there were always people who just weren't into the party scene and they weren't pressured to go out if they didn't want to. My sister goes there now and she doesn't party. I don't think she's been to High Street even once. Her friends/roommates aren't into partying either. It's a non-issue. You'll be fine.

(bc the more likely you are to find people you connect with)\n\nin terms of dorms i dont necessarily have a perfect answer for you. but, if you are going for a specific major thats popular check out an llc. this is usually a floor for all people with the same major. this was nice for me because everyone was in the same classes and you had a built in study buddy system basically. if your major doesnt have that, places like oakland have a high percentage of athletes and typically they dont confuse work with play (aka they are pretty responsible) places like dadisman and stalnaker have a bit more of a reputation for being \u201ccrazy\u201d (plus they are near the frats & bars) so steering away from there might be in your best interest. you\u2019ll get partiers in any dorm, but there are definitely some environments like that that could be easy enough to avoid/work with.",

It was pretty consistently around $365 and was applicable from August 1-July 31 of the next year, and there were no restrictions on when you could use it (though, typically overnight parking for multiple days was frowned upon, but campus parking wouldn\u2019t really have a way of knowing that you weren\u2019t just a CAC student in the building at night). I never had an issue finding spots, granted the later in the morning you arrive the more likely you\u2019d have to park further back in the lot. \n\nI recommend the CAC parking pass if you\u2019re on Evansdale frequently. It\u2019s about a 5 min walk to the Evansdale Crossing PRT station, 10ish minutes from the library, and you don\u2019t have to worry about paying every single time you come to campus. It comes out to $1 per day for a whole year with no limits on when you can park in the lot versus potentially spending $3-10 each day throughout the semester depending on how many hours you\u2019re paying for. Saving the hassle of using the ParkMobile app or lot kiosks is a huge advantage imo.",

Why go somewhere that's essentially a hostile environment for your particular condition? \n\nWith that said, you mentioned that you're committed and you have love for WVU already. If that's the case and you wish to face the challenges that come with this endeavor, then go for it. As mentioned in other posts, there are ways to make your life easier, but those can only do so much. I'm in my early 30s though and have always been super logical, so I may have a different perspective on things than others here. \n\nAnyway, with my perspective, I just see no reason to voluntarily put yourself in a tough situation- unless of course that tough situation is one that is going to challenge you and make you grow. In your case, I don't think giving yourself hills to climb is going to make POTS go away.\n\nJust my 2 cents OP. You got this whatever you do :)",

What she said boils down to this:\n\nWVU keeps cutting seats, taking less and less students despite a huge nursing shortage and even higher demand for nursing programs. If you go into pre-nursing, she said you need *at least* a 3.7 to be even remotely competitive for an actual spot in the clinical portion. If you don't get into the clinical portion, you spent 2 years on pre-classes that may or may not transfer over to another major, so expect extra time to graduate.\n\nI'm currently taking an o-chem class, and from what I've gathered talking to people at other unis, WVU has some of the most ridiculous Chem programs in the country. The Chem 233 (ochem 1) here is typically a 350+ level class in other universities in terms of how much is covered and the level of expertise you're expected to walk away with.\n\nUnless you're sure you're going to be a 4.0 student, have excellent study skills and time management, and essentially have no life obligations outside of school, go somewhere less stuck up their own butts. Tons of other places offer BSN degrees, or even accelerated RN programs and don't go so far out of their way to ensure people can't actually do the program. They do the same thing with the med school: huge shortage of doctors, smaller and smaller class sizes to make/keep people stressed to the point of a breakdown even trying to get in. One bad class can mean not even being competitive.\n\nMy degree is from here, and I'm working on another, but that's *literally* only because of in-state tuition and my program not being offered anywhere else in the state. If out of state wasn't so expensive elsewhere though, I'd transfer out in a second and be 100x less stressed. WVU is so desperate to get away from the \"party school\" association that they're just making a name for themselves as being a school to avoid for their academics.\n\nEdit: it's also worth noting that in state tuition, living off campus, is ~$4750 a semester, no books or supplies. Health sciences, meaning nursing and all similar programs, also require you to spend about $2000 *through them* on a dinky MacBook and software, regardless of how good your current machine is, at the beginning of your program. Even though you \"own\" said laptop, their surveillance software and everything is required so it's more or less a school laptop you're on the hook for and have no choice in.",

I'm willing to bet about 85% of your course load will simply be something you remember for an exam and then never think of it again for your entire life.\n\nThe majority of my family is in healthcare, so I feel you. WVU just has too much of a focus on making classes harder for no real world outcome except gatekeeping STEM degrees.\n\nI have a friend who was an engineering major. Day 1 one his Calc 2 class, his professor walked in and told them \"don't complain to me if you don't get something. I don't care if you fail because it won't hurt my job at all.\" He transferred out to Pitt and literally seemed like a different person after a month because the other Uni treated their students with basic respect and *wanted* them to succeed.

Insanely talented teacher and producer, as well as just an interesting dude all around. HOWEVER, you will be severely hindering yourself with the location. Depending on the kind of work you\u2019re trying to do, Morgantown may have an absolute dearth of real-world experience for you. My advice? Get up to Pittsburgh as often as you can, that\u2019s where you\u2019ll do your real learning; Darko will even tell you that the degree is kinda pointless, the REAL experience comes from the field. If you don\u2019t have a car, there\u2019s a shuttle that runs from Morgantown to Pittsburgh frequently. USE IT. When I was there, I spent almost every weekend up in the city either gigging or existing in the scene, and that gave me so many amazing, once-in-a-lifetime opportunities that I just wouldn\u2019t have gotten bumbling around Morgantown all the time. Pittsburgh has a good live music scene, so no matter what, you\u2019ll have better luck as a working professional up there, anyway.\n\nAs for general College of Music advice? Involve yourself with as many programs/ensembles as possible, even the ones you aren\u2019t immediately attracted to. I PROMISE you, it will prove to be invaluable for your development in the field. The more that you can talk about music as a whole, the better musician you\u2019ll be.",

Students can use public transit for free with ID, but it\u2019s not super transit friendly (if you won\u2019t have a car, check out busride.org to look at routes and schedules). In terms of restaurants, Morgantown punches above its weight. The only restaurants I wish we had are German and Korean. Morgantown is also only a little more than an hour from Pittsburgh, which is another city that punches above its weight in terms of food and cultural activities.\n\nYou could be really happy living in Morgantown.

I know a few of the administrators in that college and they\u2019re good people who look out for their students.

Sometimes they get your stuff done in less than 24 hours, sometimes you have to harass them in order to get stuff done.\n\nParking is okay, except there's no guest parking. Also if you get the upper lot you CANNOT forget to lock your car or else a homeless man will live in it for a night.\n\nPets are allowed, which is a pro and a con. If you want a pet, it can be great. But sometimes you get dogs barking incessantly or at god awful hours.\n\nThe view is great for some apartments, others are looking at the middle school or a dirt hill.\n\nPeople are loud on weekends. To me this doesn't matter but if you're not a night owl it may.\n\nThe furniture is actually pretty nice and it comes fully furnished which is a bonus.\nHowever some bedrooms are small and don't fit the furniture in great ways.\n\nPackages are safe. This is a huge issue with some places, here it's not a problem. You don't have to worry about your stuff getting stolen.\n\nThe walk to class is fine if you don't wanna deal with the shuttle, the walk back... all uphill.\n\nThe complex itself is generally safe. We couldn't lock our door for a few days because I had lost my keys (they were stolen out of my car that got broken into on the upper lot) and had no issues during that time.\n\nThe electric allowance either isn't enough or they charge you no matter what, haven't figured that one out yet.",

All I can say is, even if it looks close, go on Google earth and look at the terrain. The hills are no joke and sneak up on you. Next to campus on map, might be a 30 minute walk actually. Prob a good idea to poke around on street view anyway to look at sidewalks and stuff.\n\nDowntown university apartments are like vandalia, uplace and one other one. You\u2019ll most definitely have a roommate there if $1100 is looking steep for you.\n\nGood luck. Rough time of year for apartment shopping. Try looking for sublets.

Assuming you're not also waiting to hear from some Ivy League schools or a service academy, WVU is as good as any other school out there.    \n\n\nYou're going to get out of it what you put in, to an extent.  It's hardly any different from any other large public university out there.  You're going to meet people from all 50 states, the territories, and the majority of other countries (150+ most years, I think).  You're going to have opportunities for travel, short and long.  Or you can do the Animal House thing and drink your way through a 4-year degree if that's your speed.  We don't judge here.  \n\n\nBring the right attitude and it'll probably be a great 4-6 years.  Bring a shitty one and it'll almost certainly suck until you drop out or transfer.  So come to Morgantown bright-eyed and bushy-tailed, and ready to meet new people and learn new things, and in a few years come back to this sub and tell some other freshly-accepted young person how to make the best of it.  \n\n\nI can't really answer your last question.  Only you can.  Good luck to you, and I sincerely hope your answer turns out to be \"HELL YES IT IS\".",

Most colleges are the same and as long as you get a degree it doesn't really matter where you went unless it's a ivy league or something.

Look at the business school\u2019s and other schools\u2019 career fair sites on what businesses come to campus to recruit students. You mentioned living 9 hours away and that you will study finance. A lot of companies that go to WVU to recruit for interns and graduates are regionally based in the mid-Atlantic states. Do you plan to go back home after you graduate? Does WVU have an alumni chapter in your area where you can network with alumni regionally? On LinkedIn, look at WVU grads at your ideal dream job and look at their career paths. I am in the financial sector. A few of my friends from school have also had successful careers in the industry. All of us will tell you that we loved our time at WVU and our education served us well. That said, if your goal is to work on Wall Street for a specific firm, look at where that firm recruits and where their graduates go to school. For example, my company largely only goes to the Ivy League campuses for interns because they are right outside our office doors. A firm from your hometown might not send recruits to WVU but a company in Pittsburgh with a lot of WVU grads will.",

As an Econ major, I have had the opportunity to speak and connect with Nobel Prize Winner in Economics Vernon Smith, as well as many highly distinguished Economists and researchers.\n\nAside from that, the campus is beautiful, fun can always be found in that town (often too much), and the people are amazing. I will always remember the community and hospitality of Morgantown. Everyone is friends, probably because they\u2019re always drunk.\n\nThe Mountaineer family is amazing, and doesn\u2019t consist of just alumni \u2014 it\u2019s an entire state of near 2 million people, plus all of the Mountaineers across the country and abroad (we travel well lol).\n\nIt\u2019s worthwhile to become a Mountaineer if you want to be a part of something that feels truly special.",

When we don't have fun, we're all ready to run into traffic though.\n\nAcademically WVU is standard. Which has its pros and cons. It will never look as good as Yale on your resume one day, but the pressure to do well being low is also beneficial for some. Not everyone wants to break their back to do well.\n\nPrice of living is average as well. It's cheaper than a school in Fort Lauderdale or NYC but more expensive than some random college in the middle of a state. \n\nCrime rates are kind of ridiculous for how small the town is, but are lower than at big city schools\n \nDiversity wise - there's lots of different types of people - but most of them are white. \n\nI love WVU, I wouldn't change my decision if I had the chance. But it is not a school for everyone. People who have good school-life balance and like drinking or smoking weed typically have a better time here.",

        "body": "I graduate in a month and I have mixed feelings for a variety of reasons.\n\nFirstly, was the change in leadership in the Marching Band. I was a member from 18-21 and I basically watched that program collapse culturally as the revolving door of leadership consumed it. Traditions and motivation flew out the window as the leadership became too focused on \"the brand.\" Things honestly weren't that bad pre-covid, but all it was to me was people telling me how much better things USED to be. A staple of the school as a whole tbh. Be it athletics, culture, or even Morgantown itself. The entire time I've been here it felt like I got here too late.\n\nSimilar to what someone else said, this place changed DRAMATICALLY after covid. We were sent home in the middle of my sophomore year and coming back felt like I was going to a completely different school, even after the mask mandate ended. The culture, at least on campus, felt a lot more...deflated. Could just be a me thing but that's how I felt.\n\nI was also an RA before and during covid which gave me a much clearer (mostly bad) view on how the University really feels about its students. Don't get me wrong, I knew that the administration only cared about money and their image, but after seeing how students and non-faculty employees were treated during that time. It all put a really bad taste in my mouth. I also RA'd in the good ol' Dirty D so that may have been why haha. (Long Live Floor 5)\n\nDespite all of this however, I wouldn't trade it for anything. This school built me into what I consider the best version of myself and allowed me to make invaluable memories and connections in various classes and programs, on and off campus. I discovered who I truly want to be here, and while I've seen this University at what could be argued as its lowest, I'm still very proud to say I went here. Could it have been better? Absolutely. But there's nothing I can change now and I made the most of it so I might as well look on it fondly.\n\nBut yeah, there's my cheesy-ass response nobody asked for.",

I went home, got married, and left Morgantown in the rearview mirror. \n\nSoon after, the memories started changing. I started thinking of the good ones more than the bad ones.

I probably paid somewhere around $750 out of pocket including co-pays. But, I also saw the price before insurance and it was somewhere around $1800. I think you\u2019re gonna end up paying around that much anywhere you go because those kind of assessments are just pricey in general. \n\nStillwater was great in my experience. I did my testing with Dr. Gold and he was super thorough, explained the whole process, what each test measured, and was able to answer all of my questions. \n\nI had a psych eval done at Fremouw-Sigley a few years back and I wouldn\u2019t recommend there (I also don\u2019t know if they take the student insurance because I didn\u2019t use it at the time). The testing felt rushed, they didn\u2019t go over my results with me, there were potentially major errors on my report, and when contacting them to ask about them/see if they could be fixed or if it affected my results they said they would bring it up to the psychologist and have a corrected and emailed to me and they literally just sent the exact same document again with the errors still on it. They also completely missed catching my ADHD and when getting retested, Dr. Gold said he really couldn\u2019t believe they missed it because I have a family history (ADHD has very high heritability rates) and it showed in the computer test I took as well as my behavior throughout testing. \n\nSorry this was such a long reply, I just wanted to share my experience so hopefully you don\u2019t have to go through that and potentially pay a lot of money for nothing. I would look into Stillwater or call around to other places to see if they take the student insurance and can give you an estimate of the cost for testing. Hope this helps!",

I\u2019ve never gone anywhere else before so I don\u2019t have anything to compare it to but it\u2019s been fine for me. There\u2019s only been like one instance where I was like ?? with him and that\u2019s when I told him I\u2019d read about citric acid interfering with stimulants and wanted to know if that was true or not and he said it wasn\u2019t. But afterwards I did a lot of research myself and basically everything online says don\u2019t eat/drink anything with citric acid an hour before and after the meds or it\u2019ll make them less effective. (btw citric acid is in like every single pop which I didn\u2019t know til somewhat recently).\n\nAnother thing he didn\u2019t tell me about was that tums/any antacid increases absorption of stimulants (maybe only adderall, I can\u2019t remember now) and I think can potentially cause overdose? (I think it\u2019s only for high doses of the stimulant but def double check the overdose part). \n\nMy only other gripe with healthy minds is they always start like 15 minutes late? Idk if that\u2019s Dr. Hopkins or just the clinic, but I do tele-health and they tell me to long on 15 minutes before my appointment and then they don\u2019t start until 15 minutes after my appointment, so I\u2019ll literally be sitting there logged in for 30 mins like :/ but maybe it\u2019s different in person.",

I feel you completely about the school being so in your business but all of the files and stuff they have will be confidential, so only your doctor will be able to see them and even know you go there. If that makes you uncomfortable though you could def look for another psychiatrist in the area! \n\nAlso if you have the ADHD diagnosis now (and/or if there\u2019s any other diagnosis you got in the psych eval that affects your education) you can go to the office of accessibility at the school and they\u2019ll be able to get you certain accommodations so school won\u2019t be as rough (in ways). Not sure if this is something you know about or not but it\u2019s def helped me! Some of the accommodations I have are extra on exams (1.5x regular amount), earlier registration (like by one day?), the option for note takers (although I\u2019ve never utilized this one), a different exam location (for less distractions and is usually in the testing center in the library basement but sometimes professors will have me take them in their office, but if you do the testing center you have to make an appointment online or by phone), and periodic breaks during classes/exams. (If you go to the office of accessibility they\u2019ll be able to explain all of this to you too and probably better than I am.)\n\nYou would have to send your psych eval to the office of accessibility and they would look at it and talk with you abt what accommodations you can get. (If you think any of mine sound helpful to you, bring it up to them cause this is one of those things where you just have to ask for specific ones sometimes.) And also only your case worker there will see your psych eval, no one else. Then you can send those accommodations to your professors each semester and you usually have to have a meeting with them about how they can meet those accommodations, but I\u2019ve never had any problems with it.",

I\u2019m not a picky eater, but I think it goes without saying that pink chicken and black pizza are not good for your diet. \nI would suggest getting the plan with the most dining dollars and spending them wisely at restaurants on campus that take them. I usually eat at the dining hall once a day for dinner and try to eat cereal or a small breakfast in my dorm and snacks throughout the day. I avoid Hatfields even though it\u2019s the dining hall closest to me. Towers has been the best dining hall i\u2019ve had so far. Summit has a deli in their dining hall that never misses.

Not to scare you away, because I truly believe that it\u2019s incredibly interesting, and if your heart is set, to make sure that you\u2019re ready to buckle down and put in hours and hours of pure studying that are required to do well. The class that really did it for me was Molecular Biology (BIOL 219) with DHL, which is a far reach from what is taught in 115/117. I just changed my major, because I thought of it as \u201cif I do complete this undergrad, but I don\u2019t get into med school, do I truly have anything that I want to do with this degree that I\u2019m working toward?\u201d My answer was no, so now I\u2019m finishing out this semester then getting into engineering. I believe that if you\u2019re dedicated enough, and willing to actually put in the effort to get nothing except A\u2019s and sparse B\u2019s, then go for it, I believe in you. A few tips that I have for you are to go to office hours instead of parties (I never have gone to any parties, but I didn\u2019t utilize that time wisely either). The portion of professors and TAs that just sit in their offices has to be in the 90% range, so if you go then not only will they get to know you better and want to help you even more, but they\u2019ll appreciate you for helping them not waste their time by holding said office hours. We have amazing resources outside of just Prof. office hours, you just have to look around (something well explained in the introductory BIOL 191 class, which is basically a semester\u2019s worth of orientation). I hate biology now, but don\u2019t let it discourage you, if you\u2019ve got the commitment and self discipline, go for it",

This is the biggest mistake I have seen prospective medical students make. \n\nChoose a major that you will enjoy (for the most part), that covers your prereqs, and be a varied multifaceted human being. I did a dual degree B.A. in biology and foreign languages and was pretty much done with my bio degree and med school pre-reqs by the middle of my junior year (did some summer classes) so just enjoyed my language courses the last 18 months of university and it was great, and this reflected well on my medical school application because I actually had something to talk about. \n\nMedical school \"prep\" is getting your prereqs (not hard at all), getting a good science GPA (3.8+ is the goal), getting a good MCAT (50%ile is a good target for WVUSOM), and having extra-curriculars to show you're a well-rounded individual (including some volunteer hours, undergrad research, part-time job, etc.) \n\nPlease note that I am now almost 10 years out from my med school applications so some things may have changed...but I doubt it.\n\nFor what it's worth, had I done it again, I would've gone with Biochem instead of bio, although idk if I would've been able to get the dual degree since bio was a B.A. Some of the bio courses were great but some were just blegh.

But as a general rule of thumb I\u2019d say start looking seriously for a place roughly 5-6months before you want to move in because that\u2019s when most places are asking their renters for renewal agreements. So most won\u2019t even know if they have availability before then.",

The two that really stand out to me is that blind hill in front of Ming and the bottom of the Vandalia Hill. I've personally almost gotten hit by cars in those two 'crosswalks' numerous times and I'm very cautious. I'm never on my phone, always looking up, make sure to check, etc. If you aren't using those crosswalks during busy campus times, where you have enough students to basically make a shield, people do not give a shit. People fly up that blind hill in front of Ming despite there being a massive pedestrian sign. Or my personal favorite is when people just speed through when you're literally still in the crosswalk. They even ripped the lights out of the one at the bottom of Vandalia, making it even more dangerous now.  I don't know how the city might be able to change the infrastructure to make it car and people friendly, but actually having some sort of consequence for driving like a douche nozzle in a town this populated would be nice. Maybe a speed trap on University Avenue or something similar would at least make things slightly better.",

Riding a bike to some places is borderline impossible unless you\u2019re a Olympic cyclist. I know people that have competed in cycling events and even they have to get off and walk sometimes. \n\nThe big issue is there\u2019s no give and take between anyone. People walk out into traffic with absolutely zero regard for the fact that there\u2019s 5k lb pieces of machinery coming at them. Nobody looks up from their phone, driving or walking. Pedestrians can\u2019t take turns with the cars. \n\nAbove all else, there shouldn\u2019t be a crossing area on the main artery through campus. They built that stupid ass bridge at Ming, that you have to climb three flights of stairs to use and is so far out of the way it\u2019s ridiculous. Why they can\u2019t make a ramp based walkway that goes over the road is beyond me. It\u2019s not that hard. Then cars can go without worrying about people. \n\nHowever I\u2019m strongly against closing roads or more traffic lights in this town. WV has the most annoying lights that run cycles when there isn\u2019t a car. The lights in PA and the DMV will skip the turn lane if there\u2019s no cars there, and won\u2019t cycle until traffic actually shows up. I\u2019ve blown several reds down here in the middle of the night because I\u2019m not waiting 10 minutes for a light that\u2019s programmed for rush hour to change at 1AM. Traffic is increasing here, and they need to widen and add roads to accommodate it. Not make wider sidewalks you could land a 747 on. The new walkway at 8th street is a disaster and forces cars turning on to university from 8th into the oncoming lane. Same with the buses turning right onto 8th, they can\u2019t make that turn with the fucking stupid 2ft high curb in the way.",

If a road was paved this year, it was planned 5-years ago), lack of community input (I attended a traffic board meeting a couple years ago where they had like 6 new crosswalks to lay or the thermoplastic would expire, so they literally just sat and discussed where they should go.

The terrain of campus itself is not so bad that we need to prioritize cars over pedestrians always. Much of the vehicle traffic is thru-traffic, it's not students driving through campus to park.You're talking about making the campus even less walkable so we can further induce demand for driving. Widening roads and adding more lanes often just causes more people to drive, on the margin. I think, instead, the school/town should move toward more walkability so that there is less incentive to drive. There can still be commuter lots and, if anything, expanded shuttle/PRT service from areas where people can park. Space on the downtown campus is too scarce to make it even better for cars. There are areas where the sidewalk is extremely narrow or has no height; this is extremely dangerous and, again, prioritizes vehicles. Why do we want a system where the incentive is to drive everywhere even when something is a few hundred yards away?\n\nIn the case of the 8th street walkway, there should be a crosswalk on the 8th street part instead of the double walkways on university, not sure what they were thinking with that. I am glad they widened the extremely narrow sidewalk, wish they would do it on the walk up to metro towers on university ave.",

It has known about them even well before I was a student in the early 00s. It has slowly but surely made improvements like the signal that an idiot driver took out at Falling Run.

If it ever comes back, they also had a running kitty for a \"bonus\" question - pay for tickets, two people get picked and you get asked a random obscure question. If no one got it, the jackpot rolled over. That hit over $2K at one point.\n\nMy group frequented there, Primantis and  Gibbies (who has my vote for best host), with cameos on other nights and locations to make sure we qualified for the big game and probe defenses for easy money. Crockett's was on a weird night for our schedules, but the regulars were pretty casual - might still be that way. If so, that'd also be my vote for best wings on the circuit.\n\nIt's a great way to subsidize a drinking habit. My buddy and I didn't pay for drinks at Gibbies for like two months straight.

The previous property manager corey was a despicable liar that was insanely incompetent (i was given an apartment with bedbugs and he refused to pay for my hotel and lied about when new apartment would be ready). There is a lot more but I just hope he never gets another job ever again.\n\nI have had little interaction with the new management  aside from maintenance and noise complaints. The new Maintenance crew is decent tho recently they\u2019ve dropped the ball on warning me when they are coming and what they did. The main office doesnt seem to take noise complaints that seriously as I have made multiple on a particularly noisy neighbor with parties lasting til 3am with bass booming. Seems they only had 1 conplaint on record when I had called and made 4 with the person I was talking to. So someone didnt actually do their job or saving their friend idk. After the main offices closes, you will only be able to leave a message. There is a HUGE (I\u2019m talking biggest I have ever seen) pothole leading onto the street to the left of the main entrance. They have yet to fix it since last winter and it has gotten so big I imagine that would absolutely break your car or even get it stuck. They just recently trimmed the foliage blocking sight of the oncoming traffic when leaving. Canvas is PRETTY FAR from evansdale so I don\u2019t recommend it for that. Also, the bus picks up at West run not canvas. Overall tho, the new management seems to be competant and way better than the previous one.\n\nUpdate: Currently dealing with mice in the walls and canvas property manager has YET to book an exterminator after we reported it 7 DAYS AGO. Property manager has been unavailable to reach by phone, in-person, or email these entire 7 days and has not responded to any emails. Absolutely awful management.",

I decided to leave a poor review (and received flack from the owner) but I refrained from doing a PSA elsewhere because of a few reasons: (a) the review is just one experience; and (b) the restaurant is local and I am all for supporting local even if I had a poor experience. I don\u2019t want to go out of my way tarnish the reputation of a local business even if I got unlucky with my experience. However, if the experience were to be more severe (e.g. blatant discrimination or something egregious) I would then publicize it.\n\n(2) I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a privacy concern or yours, but I imagine it\u2019s fairly easy to connect your public reviews with your Reddit account.

The owner chose to operate knowing that there were gnats everywhere (she claims every restaurant in morgantown has gnats...), and that they were short staffed and didn't have many of their most popular menu items available. They could have closed for the day. It wasn't luck - it was a deliberate choice by the owners of the business.\n\nThirdly, initially I only posted a simple two-sentence review on facebook. I figured that was enough - just wanted my 2 cents to be heard. But once she started attacking myself and my friends and calling us names and whatnot, THAT's when I decided more people needed to be aware of what kind of people they are, and posted it here.\n\nAnd while I appreciate the account privacy comment, I did already consider this. Honestly, my reviews have all been written with my real legal name, for legitimacy and transparency, and I don't really care if anybody \"links\" any of those to my reddit account or this post, because everything I'm saying is true.

I worked for OIT and my permit was for multi lots and still had to make a monthly trip to the parking office to get them dropped.  Even as an employee you got crap from them. I would like to add that I had to pay for my own permit as well. Some depts paid for them but most make you pay for your own. Oh and what fun it can be to get them to transfer permits when you have a rental because your daily is in the shop and they keep bombing the rental with tickets.",

Reversals are kind of dicey because they're expensive, usually not covered by insurance, and after enough time has passed, the success rate is only around 50%.\n\nBut if I change my mind for some reason down the road and I want kids, there are plenty of options that don't require my DNA. I imagine the need for adoption in many states will spike shortly if it hasn't already. If I absolutely lose my mind and really really want the kid to be \"mine\" for some reason, you can also have sperm surgically extracted and do IVF with it. The vasectomy just prevents sperm from getting into the semen, it doesn't stop it from being produced completely.\n\nWhile it wouldn't change my mind one bit if it did, a vasectomy doesn't mean \"never having kids.\" Just probably means not having a kid with your genes, which many adoptive, foster, and step parents will tell you doesn't diminish the experience of parenthood one bit.",

        "body": "It's complicated. WVU has an unfair burden in that it takes on a lot of the responsibility to accept in state students. WV being the second poorest per capita and one that has less to spend on public education puts our incoming admission stats on the low end.\n\nOn top of that, I've heard tell that we've also had an ongoing antagonistic relationship with USNWR from my understanding which explains some of the gaps between us and other \"bad\" schools like Louisville. And if you look at other rankings sites, the disparity isn't nearly as pronounced. \n\nGee and Clements have started the long haul to help makeover the state university system and improve our standing as a research institution going from R2 to R1... but again, we're a small state with a disproportionately small tax base so they're trying to balance all that out against the broader mission of providing higher education to a significantly disadvantaged population.\n\nFurther complicating matters, revenue -wise WVU found itself a niche to survive in those already tough conditions by being the cheap out of state option with lower standards that's happy to take your money.\n\nWVU could probably game that system to move up into the top 200 in a few years, but unless we uncork some economy-shifting, Nobel Prize-winning discovery, they're not letting us in the AAU country club, ever. \n\nThat said, you can get a top-notch education at WVU in a variety of disciplines (assuming you want to find them). Case in point we've had 3 times as many Rhodes Scholars than \"good\" AAU-member schools like Pitt. We're tied for 30th all-time with 24), that's more than Ivy League member Penn and 3 shy of tying Cornell... but this isn't a school that is going to open doors for you on name recognition alone.",

WVU is Job 2214 I the Olmstead Flickr archives.\n\nhttps://www.flickr.com/photos/olmsted_archives/albums/72157666854405696/\n\nThat layout predates Stalnaker/Women's Hall by 35 years. Pretty sure the downtown campus was on that plan early on - if I remember correctly from some history books, Commencement Hall and the Armory and the drill grounds were all built but quickly became insufficient for what was needed - they originally played football at the drill grounds before old mountaineer field was built in 1924 and basketball in commencement hall before the Field house in 1929. Part of me wants to say there were drainage issues with the layout.\n\nThe only building left from that block is Stuart Hall - the OG library.\n\nIMO they need to sink University Ave. as much as possible at Grumbien's Island and build a landscaped bridge - like wildlife crossings - that makes as level a walk to the other side of the street as possible while letting traffic flow underneath.",

If you mention you\u2019ll need an aid, they might already have resources in place for you or have suggestions on where to look! \n\nAs for the wheelchair, there were students who used wheelchairs in the dorm I used to work at. We had rooms to accommodate for them (such as the showers and sinks being modified for wheelchair space). However, I\u2019m not certain all of the dorms are wheelchair accessible so you should double check with housing when you reach out.\n\nAs for campus accessibility, there\u2019s a van. I\u2019m pretty sure you would work with accessibility services and the driver to get your schedule set up so they\u2019d be able to pick up and drop you off where you need to be for classes/back to your dorm. Accessibility services will also be able to give you access to elevators to help get around the different campus buildings.

Lyons quickly gave him an extension to kill all that talk.  Now it turns out to be a horrible move.  Nothing will change, these coaches will still get these stupid contracts and WVU will have to play along just like any other school that wants to at least attempt to be relevant in football.

The reality imo is we will never be a top playoff caliber program. Our path to the playoff is possibly one of the hardest in the NCAA considering the fact we are not in the B10 or SEC. On top of the B12 conference rules that every team plays eachother for position. Additionally we had one sniff of playoffs with Clint Tricket....I was at the game we were eliminated from contention, there was no way in hell we would have gotten or survived the first round even if we beat TCU. In my head wvu is a middling program perfect for ACC like status where success is winning season and a good bowl game. How does this relate to brown and current trajectory? Who do we get other than Brown? What would be the short term benefit of destroying program continuity? We won't be in any better spot. A new coach is not going to come in and propell our current state to top tier competitive status. Our program needs a serious rebuild which will have loosing/.500 seasons. My confidence in rebounding after firing Brown is even more pessimistic seeing the names being thrown out there....Coach O....really? How many NCAA Mike Babcocks will our fanbase want to go through all in the name of removing Brown. If there was a clear path beyond Brown sure let's give it a shot but as the current situation lies, we probably be getting another Neil brown a shot in the P5 and be exactly where we are.\n\nEdit: I am being downvoted, and as I said earlier I will be the first to say I am wrong and a dumdum.

That said, I don\u2019t think it is unreasonable to expect 7-8 wins per year and maybe making a good push to 10 or even 11 wins once every 4-5 years. Dana had one season with less than 7 wins, and we let him walk. HCNB has never had more than 6 wins in a season, and this year seems to be headed for another repeat. We are absolutely not Bama, but there is no reason to be content with perennial losing seasons. I get that HCNB has had the odds stacked against him with the opening of the transfer portal and a global pandemic. That said, Chris Klieman took over at K-State the same year HCNB started, and guess what? They are 2-0 at the time of my post, already with a quality win over SEC opponent. They also won 8 games last year including a big bowl win over LSU. We should expect a similar level of success as a similarly situated school like K-state. I don\u2019t consider that unreasonable. HCNB is a great person, but 5-6 wins per year is unacceptable. Now if only we could find $16 million laying around to pay that buyout\u2026.",

Going to my first home game in at least 5 years next weekend and hoping we can get some kinks worked out and smoke some Jays!  \n\nShould have gone for it on 4th and inches.  That defense was gassed.  \n\nDonaldson was a beast.  \n\nWe need to get some mid-level passing worked in.  Ironically one of the few 5-10 yarders JT threw is the one that Wheaton inexplicably fucked up and we lost the game over on the pick 6.  \n\nIs Woods OK? \n\nThat was a stout defense and JT held up pretty well IMO.",

First, what can be done about the pace of increase in tuition at our public universities?  it has far outpaced the growth in price of most other goods and services since the 1970s, and if your buddy Gordon Gee, mister \u201cuniversities should be run like businesses\u201d, has his way, it\u2019s gonna keep right on skyrocketing regardless of median household income or whatever other considerations you may have. In a couple years, the debt erased by this announcement will be replaced more than dollar-for-dollar. Second, regardless of the 5% cap the amount owed and interest accrual will continue leaving lower-income borrowers with huge long-term unsecured debt. it could potentially grow each year in spite of a lifetime of good-faith payments at the 5% cap. I don\u2019t expect most folks with bachelor degrees to ever pay off an unsubsidized balance. (Thanks, Obama, for redirecting billions in subsidies so I could have an extra $150 annual Pell grant. GG bro.)\n\nStill, *some* of us will see some relief. Others will be right back in over their heads in a few years. This is a band aid on a bullet hole, as the saying used to go. It\u2019s halfassery. So at least in that way it\u2019s still signature Biden/Obama policy. \n\nY\u2019all shoulda elected Sanders, ya stingy fucks.",

If you find anything he's said compelling, you should keep in mind he also says things like this:\n\n>Let\u2019s say your life depended on the following choice today: you must obtain either an affordable chair or an affordable X-ray. Which would you choose to obtain? Obviously, you\u2019d choose the chair. That\u2019s because there are many types of chair, produced by scores of different companies and widely distributed. You could buy a $15 folding chair or a $1,000 antique without the slightest difficulty. By contrast, to obtain an X-ray you\u2019d have to work with your insurance company, wait for an appointment, and then haggle over price. Why? Because the medical market is far more regulated \u2014 thanks to the widespread perception that health care is a \u201cright\u201d \u2014 than the chair market. Does that sound soulless? True soullessness is depriving people of the choices they require because you\u2019re more interested in patting yourself on the back by inventing rights than by incentivizing the creation of goods and services. In health care, we could use a lot less virtue signaling and a lot less government. Or we could just read Senator Sanders\u2019s tweets while we wait in line for a government-sponsored surgery \u2014 dying, presumably, in a decrepit chair.\n\n\n*****\n\n^(I'm a bot.

That same case of 60 eggs is now 10.50. A 50% increase. Diesel fuel is pushing $6/gallon, and all the products get there on a truck that consumes about 300 gallons of fuel to fill up from empty.

There is a nice DnD group, and a book club (also mostly history students, never gonna guess who I am friends with lol) that is also pretty much any grad wvu student welcome. \n\nAs for more \"calm\" places, I would recommend the Apothicary, but maybe not for a month or two as they just moved locations and everyone wants to check it out. Mundy's is also a calmer more townie bar but that could be a minus too as it's less students. \n1\n123 is my favorite place for music and more of a \"scene\".

I also go to local coffee shops and chat with others (e.g. Antiquitea is cute, the owners are friendly, and they run community  events).\n\nI understand some of this may consist of you coming out of your comfort zone as an introvert, so, I'd say start by finding a group of people doing something you're also interested in/comfortable with and go from there.\n\nFeel free to pm me if you'd like!",

I would always take advantage of that and only actually buy the course materials if there were those annoying digital codes you had to put in. While there were several books that had to stay in the library (especially when I got into upper-level classes and they were the hyper-specific ones written by the professor) it was still pretty good because having to stay in the library forced me to actually study and do the work. Plus the library staff was always super helpful when it came to research, editing, and projects so having a good relationship with them proved very beneficial (I also learned the libraries have a ton of equipment like DSLR cameras that students can borrow). The only time I remember this tactic being a problem was when my geography final was open-book and I could not get a copy in time (still got an A). As far as deadlines, your course syllabus should have that info some do require the course text to be brought in on the first day but most will give you around two weeks to actually get it, more if there is a known shortage or problem. \n\nTLDR: the campus libraries should have what you need so check it out before buying since it is free to students, if you do purchase you should have at least a bit of time and that will be clarified in the syllabus.",

So assuming NOBODY pays twice, the university will make ~ $150,000 (more than out of state tuition 6x over or about 17x in-state) every 2 semesters, for... Painting numbers on the lot? \n\nNever mind that tuition is going up, Huggins salary went up, and the \"non-profit\" university is raising salaries to their all time highs, during a pseudo- recession, at the cost of us less fortunate.  \n\nI think the most painful thing is that we aren't getting anything out of this, but \"would they drop out over $1 a day? Especially if they never do the math?\" Has to absolutely have been said when this decision was made. If they added say, security to the lot, because my car has been dented in the coliseum lot, and my old roommate parked there and got their license plate stolen in broad daylight, maybe people wouldn't be upset. Or maybe more frequent transit from the coliseum to the Engineering PRT, because that distance is about 0.3-0.5 mi, and while it isn't the largest distance, walking a half mile sucks when you're late for class. : ^) \n\nHonestly, I'd be half as mad if they donated that money to the city of Morgantown for local road repairs, because it isn't going to the upkeep of WVU lots, they are already pristine, and get additional maintenance every year. \n\nWVU parking is a joke. If you're an employee of the university, a higher priced parking pass is automatically taken out of your salary for whatever lot you'd be using most. If you're a student you get nickel and dime'd by a corporation that couldn't care less. \n\nSincerely,\n A soon to be former engineering student, who is a full time student, and works full time hours at the university, and parks in the coliseum lot, roughly 600 times over the past 3 years.",

They may subject you to a house tour and a few questions but generally they will just let you party. \n2. If it's the middle of a semester some frats will let you in if you have a high enough female to male ratio, a lot of times a group of girls will adopt you if you ask.\n3. If the two above fail the ONLY frat I know to consistently allow guys in is AEPi. They typically charge a $5-$10 cover, but will let you party as long as you don't offend a brother.\n\nI don't know a whole lot about house parties.

Their reasoning is you can do everything you can with a business degree, but it\u2019s more unique and stands out. My only worry was going far into the exam of a profession I don\u2019t plan to do. \n\nAs for the career question, I really do not know\u2026 I just know I\u2019m not interested in a generic cubicle accountant environment. I\u2019m mainly considering the positivity of a career in firefighting, and having a business on the side that perhaps can become my full time job after retiring from the fire service. I may not do firefighting and just go into starting a business. I have many patent ideas so hopefully I can advance with one.",

I would recommend looking into it.\nAnother trail that\u2019s more out of the way and more of a hike is the one at coopers rock.\nThose are the two that come to mind off the top of the head but be sure to drop by the student rec center (it has some great resources, a great indoor gym and is free so long as you are registered for classes; they can look you up by your student id if you don\u2019t have your card yet) as they have more information and even plan trips for similar activities that you might be interested in.",

Depending on where you live or if you're planning to go after classes I could give a few suggestions. Hills to avoid would be easier to identify probably. \n\nSouth Park is really quiet and good for running, but not exactly close. The river trail is good, but not exactly a loop.   The arboretum is nice, but you're going to get spiders to the face since it isn't well traveled, and it is near the coliseum so not downtown either. \n\nMy first suggestion would be run down high street and back up the next block up away from the river.  It is a hill, but not very bad, goes a long way, and coming back up doesn't get steep til the book exchange end.  My second suggestion would be at Evansdale, around and through that campus.   You could start anywhere as I'm pretty sure they had to level most of the area. There's a chance you have a class or two up there, but even if you don't the cafeteria is great and there's a library plus the rec center.  Tons of amenities for you.   Third suggestion would be to ride to Towers PRT and run back to downtown. I don't love this as there's not a lot of sidewalk, but it is good practice for if you need to get somewhere and the PRT is down and busses aren't running. You may need to know the path to take. \n\nDoes not happen often, but did happen to me once. On a date. We left the CAC late during a snow storm.   Most memorable date. There's a lot (or were a lot) of small businesses through there that you wouldn't otherwise know about.",

It stretches 33 miles from Point Marion, PA to Fairmont, so I don't think you'll run out of room lol. Also, the Decker's Creek Trail branches off of the Mon River Trail, and that goes 20 miles out all the way to Reedsville. I've certainly never taken any of them all the way to their end, but they should be in good shape if they're anything like the Morgantown portion. Just stay off the trails after dark. Homeless frequent them then. But you'll have no issues in the day time.\n\nIf you really want a loop, then you could take the Mon River Trail to the Arboretum, walk through it (hilly dirt trails), and then either run down Patteson Dr or through Evansdale campus, and then run up University Ave to take you back to downtown. That's about a 4 mile round trip from Summit/Honors. Just know that University Ave is quite a hill. Also, be careful crossing Monongahela Blvd or Beechurst Ave. That road isn't very pedestrian-friendly, even at crosswalks.",

It\u2019s doable and you don\u2019t need to change your classes but you will have to leave your class at Ming Hseih/Life Sciences on time or early to make it to Clark/Olglebay. You most likely will not be early to your second class, but will be on time. Something I always considered too was what floor the class was on. Is you class in Clark on the first floor bc if not, you also have to account for the time to it takes to go up the stairs. The walk may only be 5 minutes between buildings but it\u2019s the time in the buildings that takes awhile.. stairs, packing up your backpack, etc. Also your situation will depend if your first class holds you till the last possible second or is late everyday. A lot of freshman classes tend to let out early, but it is professor\u2019s preference.\n\nYou got this, you just gotta be aware you have the minimum amount of time. This situation is honestly better than having an hour or two gap bc you\u2019d want to go back to your dorm and the best thing you can do is to stay on campus the entire day (and do homework between classes) until your classes are over.",

This building is very well connected to the rest of downtown. \n\nI believe to get from Ming Hsieh to Clark, you just walk through Oglebay (this will make sense once you see it), walk out in front of the lair, and it is the next building over (though if your class is up 4 flights of stairs in Clark, this will suck. Take the elevator. You'll definitely still have time for this though). \n\nTo get from Life Sciences to Oglebay, walk out the ground floor exit, walk up the big stairs next to the old business school, and go over the footbridge. You're there. \n\nI believe either of these should take less than 5 minutes to do. The campus can be intimidating at first, but you'll get the hang of it.

I\u2019m not 100% this advice works since we got stuck inside but this is what I told her. Go to everything that looks even slightly interesting to you. You are here for yourself, not to make friends, so pursue your interests, not the people. Find things that make you genuinely excited, and like minded people will notice you doing your thing. People are in abundance here. You well meet more than you probably wanted to. BUT, that\u2019s just means there are more options for friends. Keep doing the things that interest you, keep searching for the projects or clubs that are doing the things you wanna do, and the friendships will follow naturally.",

I am not a finance student so I can't say what kind of software you may find yourself using, but I wouldn't go below 8gb of RAM or an older processor just because itll slow down ur PC especially if you are trying to run several programs at once (like word, excel, and chrome yk)\n\nFor brands, I personally really like ASUS laptops although I think many people dislike them, I have a ROG STRIX III and it has held up fantastic. I also use it game and it's great, got plenty of space and power. Asus has several cheaper consumer models too.\n\nI would not recommend any Dell or HP consumer-grade laptop (Chromebooks) as some of my coworkers use them and they are so slow, just glorified web-browsers. I think it'll be frustrating probably especially if the wifi is also slow on top of ur computer being slow.\n\nMacbooks will probably be fine but u may have to become familiar with Bandcamp in order to run certain programs, again not sure if that'll be an issue as a finance major. \n\nthis is a disclaimer that i am dumb and u should take everything i say with 1-2 tbsp salt",

Usually Spanish vocabulary is super easy, on average it should take someone about a month to fully master Spanish vocabulary and be able to read it.\n\nPronunciations may be a little harder than the vocabulary especially for English speakers. One example is the Spanish R sound you will not hear this in English unless it\u2019s the American flap T. Also there is only 5 vowel sounds in Spanish compared to 15-20 in English. Although Spanish unlike English is a phonetic language which means how the words are spelt on paper are EXACTLY how they are pronounced, it\u2019s one of the most phonetic languages in the world which also makes it one of the easiest in pronunciations unlike French or English.\n\nHOWEVER Spanish grammar is where I start to get extremely challenging especially if you don\u2019t speak a Romance language like Italian, Portuguese, Romanian or French etc. The word sentence in Spanish can at some times be completely backwards compared to English or the sentence order is flipped. Here is a example.\n\nUn s\u00e1ndwich de pescado.\nA fish s\u00e1ndwich. \n\nThe sentence order is flipped here, in Spanish s\u00e1ndwich comes before the word pescado which means fish in Spanish.

I got a few extra bucks but it wasn\u2019t my main income. You also could download doordash and deliver for both if you\u2019re really set on doing it. If someone delivered my food via bike in Morgantown I\u2019d have no choice but to tip hella good.\n\nEdit: I actually have biked around Morgantown (to class and etc) but you have to be very strategic with where you bike to avoid terrain and traffic. Seems like it will be difficult to avoid the \u201cimpossible or deadly biking routes\u201d with food delivery, but if you\u2019re in that good of shape, go for it my guy.

I def recommend a bringing a mini fridge for drinks/snacks - I rented the microwave-fridge combo from the university which was really convenient, although I admit I didn\u2019t really use the microwave that much, and there is a microwave in the lounges. \n\nWith having the suite bathrooms, the classic college shower caddy is a little bulky, so I don\u2019t think I\u2019d recommend it. Something I did that I think was a good idea was see ribbon on my shower towels to make a loop so they can hang up in the bathroom/ on the bed post! Also - air freshener. Keep some by the toilet, lol. Remember to bring a bath mat just in case your roomies don\u2019t have one! \n\nI took a keurig which was nice to have, and I had a cart with drawers full of coffee, tea, and snacks. I preferred using disposable cups with it cause there\u2019s only one sink. \n\nI had the bed closer to the window which I recommend cause you have a bit more room. \n\nI spent a lot of time hanging out in the lounge! There\u2019s the main lounge on each floor (except the first floor doesn\u2019t have one) which has a tv and the microwave, and a sink. Then there\u2019s a study lounge with a board. People there usually keep pretty quiet which is nice when you have work to do. Also honors does a lot of programming and activities that were fun, like I did pumpkin painting, following a Bob Ross video, and learning about and making Jewish foods/sweets! \n\nFeel free to reach out if you have any other questions about WVU!",

I never used them to study, as I preferred the Mountainlair or the lounges in Hodges Hall, but a lot of people on my floor did.\n\nI did not really make a connection with anyone there except my roomie, but it seems like through the various planned events and lounge space with a huge TV, many people on my floor became close through the year. \n\nAs the other commenter stated, the shower room is small\u2014my caddy wasn\u2019t even that big and took up a lot of room. There is also no room to shave your legs, which was something that annoyed me constantly. I would suggest leaving a caddy at home or getting the smallest one you can. \n\nI highly recommend the micro-fridge rental that you can split with your roommate. I used my microwave daily as I did not eat in the dining halls a lot, but didn\u2019t want to use the floor microwave. \n\nI would also suggest that you have warm bedding or blankets because the AC is intense lol. I would sleep under two or three most nights. \n\nAlso it is a very good idea to have a lot of lighting so you don\u2019t use the overhead, like LED Strips, small lamps, Christmas lights. The overhead light combined with the yellow walls were not it for me.\n\nMy final suggestion is to bring a hammock if you like to sit outside. Tons of people hung them on this wooden structure out front of the dorm and would study, read, or hang out there. It looked very relaxing.\n\nOverall, the dorm itself is very nice, but I didn\u2019t make a lot of friends here. I would highly suggest going to the RA activities if you do not like to go partying or to frats, as there was something most Fridays or Saturdays, which is apparently something more unique to honors as compared to where my friends lived.",

They had a grab n go option when I was a freshman that had coffee and made to order sandwiches that I really liked, but I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s still there. There is a Starbucks close by too which is pretty neat! It\u2019s in the first floor at UPlace, and there\u2019s also like a mini grocery store there. \n\nThe Barnes n noble by the mountain lair has a cafe in it. They also serve Starbucks coffee, but they don\u2019t take Starbucks gift cards since they\u2019re a \u201cBarnes n Noble cafe\u201d. They also have baked goods, sandwiches, grab n go type snacks/pre made things, and bottled drinks, chips, candy, etc. \n\nThe mountain lair has the most options, with Chick-fil-A, Panda Express, tazikis (a Greek place), which wich, and more places opening this fall. There\u2019s also Jazzman\u2019s, a coffee shop that\u2019s pretty good! Hatfields is here too, which is also a dining hall. For breakfast they had an omelette bar which was super good, I preferred their omelette to Summit\u2019s. \n\nIn the downtown library on the fourth floor there is Eliza\u2019s, another coffee shop that also has sandwiches and stuff. I really liked it even just to eat lunch I had packed cause it\u2019s super chill there! They\u2019ve not said when it opens back up yet so hopefully it comes back soon. \n\nIf you feel like taking the bus or PRT, Evansdale also has cool options! The Crossing also has a Barnes n noble with cafe, there\u2019s a smoothie place called juice bar, a taco place, and there will be a new wing place this year on the fifth floor. In the Evansdale Library they have a coffee shop called Da Vinci\u2019s that does the MTO sandwiches and it\u2019s pretty good too! \n\nIf you wanna explore Morgantown, there are a lot of cool places you can walk to from honors hall in the downtown area. There\u2019s a chipotle, a cold stone, a cupcake place, a calzone place, a bubble tea/ poke bowl place, and a lot more! The grind is another coffee shop right across the street from white hall that is really good! \n\nThe only place I\u2019ve had to worry about what time is the mountainlair, cause there is a huge rush during mid day when everyone has a lunch break and the lines are super long, so if your break between classes is kind of short you may not have time to wait. So in my experience the best times to go there are for breakfast or late afternoon. But I\u2019d really plan around your schedule/what foods places offer to see where works best for you!",

I\u2019d usually check what\u2019s there and grab a drink then go to tazikis, late night I would always go to lyons den for things like hummus. I didn\u2019t live on campus this year but last I knew you could still get take out containers this year. I\u2019d also recommend bringing your own seasonings to keep around as the food here is often inedible just based on that alone. Good luck!!!!",

And honestly, I asked my family to also upload mounty bounty on my card because some off campus restaurants accepted it and I think all wvu food places accept it too. Then you can buy whatever you want and don\u2019t have to buy the meal plan combo. So theoretically you could get less official meal plan dining dollars and just use mounty bounty.\n\nI had 3 meal swipes a day and I hated it bc the dining hall near me didn\u2019t have grab and go and in the morning I\u2019d just want a quick snack. Then super late at night, the dining halls are closed anyway, so I really felt like I could only use a meal swipe at lunch time.\n\nThings might have changed and it\u2019s prob different depending what dorm you\u2019re in, but yeah I\u2019d say the more dining dollars or mounty bounty the better. Meal swipes are so limiting.",

They especially don\u2019t have time to sit around and wait for a judge, as the woman (and the fetus) will die on the table in a matter of minutes. Even if the law states that they \u201ccan\u201d I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll have the thought in the back of their mind that if someone prosecutor wanted to make their life hell, they could. Also people will still have access to \u201cillegal\u201d abortifacient medications, imagine someone showing up in the ER with multiple hours of vomiting and an electrolyte deficiency. Lab results commonly ordered will show they were pregnant. Now that doctor has to decide whether or not to report their patient and ruin their life or not report and risk ruining their own life. \n\nIn the case of PCPs, they\u2019ll have a similar decision when it comes to patients who they knew were pregnant then suddenly were not\u2026 report and ruin your patients life or don\u2019t report and risk ruining your own life. Also PCPs do a lot of med management\u2026 some of the medications they manage can cause SEVERE birth defects, often these medication induced defects are not compatible with life and continuing carrying the pregnancy to term can be dangerous for the mother as well. So these pregnancies are often terminated early on. Anyway not being able to terminate will lead to endangering patients lives and take a toll on provider mental health.\n\nBare in mind, doctors have one of the highest rates of suicide out of any profession (I think it\u2019s only surpassed by veterinarians). Burn out is high. Depression is high. Many will leave cause they can\u2019t bare witness let alone become participants in this sort of patient harm.\n\nAlso sorry I\u2019m kind of all over the place with these responses I\u2019m responding in between tasks on a busy week lol",

They usually push you to double major if you are in either of the first two degree paths because the second two years are extremely similar to the biology and chemistry majors, respectively. \n\nAfter the first two years, you have to pass an admissions process. If you have the grades upon admission NOW, you can become a direct admit. You will still have to do the admissions process in your second year, but you will have guaranteed entry into the program. In order to be a direct admit, you must also be in the Honors College.  If you're in the Honors College, you will also be permitted to live in the Honors Dorm, fulfilling the second portion of your question. \n\nBetween your third and fourth years, you will be required to do an internship with an approved facility. \n\nThere is a lot of math. Definitely Calc 1 and 2, but also Calc 3 for the chemisty major degree path. All of the chemistry courses (some in all three paths) are math heavy.  I highly recommend the chemistry PLTL available from the chemistry department if you do decide to do this and are worried. It is an extra hour once a week, but goes over the same principles as the class with a smaller group size.  Start it from the beginning of the semester, don't try to catch up when you need it as you're already behind.",

The first two years are  tough and you are only required to take up to Calc 1 unless you plan on going to Grad school in which case they will have you take up to Calc 2. However, getting into the program is easier than one of the other commenters mentioned. You do not need to be in the honors program, I personally was not. All you need is a C or above in the required courses in order to enter the FIS program. Which I personally struggled with in Chemistry, but I still made it into the program despite failing Chem 115. \n\nWVU had an awesome D/F repeat option so you can retake a class to do better so you aren\u2019t immediately eliminated from the program if you didn\u2019t get the grade you need on your first attempt.\n\nIn terms of quietness, there are a ton of places you can go to to avoide the noise.

I would definitely make sure you know the basics on taking care of yourself: how to do laundry/hygiene; how to grocery shop and know a few basic dorm meals, and most importantly  find a good place to focus and study outside your dorm or apartment. \n\nI didn't really like beer back then but grew to love it, so maybe get a jump on that because it's a great way to make friends if you can put some of those back without making a complete jackass of yourself. The dorm RA's have a superpower for smelling weed, so dont even open the bag in the dorms. Roll the blunt outside and scope out some good spots ahead of time. \n\nDon't rely on your freshman dorm mates to be your complete friend circle. They will drop you so fast if you get kicked out of the dorms, or if any of them do greek life. Which by the way don't feel like you have to join a frat because there is so many more parties than that that normal people throw. \n\n123 Pleasant street is a treasure. Look at the lineups every so often and just drop by. Great live music venue. \n\nIf you plan on doing meal plan, look up the cost and perhaps consider just loading that amount of money into dining dollars instead. All WVU cafes and many local takeout joints accept it. There will be better food, more flexibility, and no paying for breakfast that you end up sleeping through anyway. Most textbooks are available to pirate online for free. Search google for \"*Name of Textbook\" filetype: PDF* to look for free downloads. Or check other pirate sites.\n\nMake friends with people who have trucks or jeeps or any kind of 4x4. Convince them to drive you all to Blue Hole on a nice warm day. Renting a pontoon boat on Lake Cheat was another one of my favorite Morgantown things to do on a hot day. \n\nDon't go home every weekend. Really dont. I dont understand people who did that all the time as a freshman. Don't spend Friday or Saturday night in your dorm either. At least go walk around and explore the whole town, all the way up Richwood, Stewart, and Jones; down all the way deep into South Park. Some of the best connections and be made by just walking around, saying hi, and being open to anything.\n\nGood luck!",

That *may* present some challenges that your freshmen peers won't have to deal with...I don't have the personal experience to say one way or another, but it's something to be prepared for.  Besides that...\n\n- remember that this isn't grade school anymore.  You (or someone) is paying for your privilege to be there. It's a waste of your time and money to not take it seriously.  Unlike your school experience up to now, you should view the educational part of college as an opportunity, not an obligation.\n\n- This goes along with the first one, but GO TO CLASS. The number one reason most folks that I knew who washed out in the first year were those didn't know how to handle their newfound freedom and independence and prioritized partying and social life over the education they were there to get in the first place...but I guarantee you that there is time for both.\n\n- I recommend living in the dorms freshman year. This is how you meet people and form social connections.\n\n- Nobody really knows what they want \"to be\" as far as your future career is concerned at your age. You may get into a major or field of study and realize that it's not for you...and that's fine. Fortunately, the first year or two is typically focused on more general prerequisite classes that can be applied to a variety of majors, so don't afraid to go in open minded and evaluate your course of study as you go...but also be aware that it will be harder to change majors without requiring extra work the further along you get.",

Make sure you are getting yourself up in the morning and taking care of breakfast and getting to school on time. It is so easy to slip from getting to highschool at 7:00 to not making your 8:30 class. Even if you think you know the material well or can easily study it on your own, attendance matters. Do not skip classes. Always keep a pencil and a scantron sheet on you.\n\nFigure out where all of your classes are and how to get there well before the first day. Also, make sure to learn building names.\n\nBeing underage, going clubs won't be an option. Take advantage of Up All Night or whatever it going on at the Lair. Join some campus clubs. Not just scholarly ones, but check out boxing or something fun. I personally loved my time in APO a co-ed service fraternity. You'll meet new people (including upperclassmen) and there will be house parties and meet ups you can go to.\n\nTake advantage of study abroad opportunities.",

If you need to verify that, just call the housing administration and ask, but I feel like as long as you're not bringing a whole trailer full of stuff (no joke, I've seen it) and just have your parents bring a couple boxes in when they get there, no one is going to care.

Your major should have a very very general \u201cplan of study\u201d on their website that shows the recommended classes for your first semester. You could use that to see what type of GEFs your advisor will probably recommend, and then look on schedule builder or star for classes that interest you. This way you\u2019re less likely to pick a random GEF out of a hat if they ask you to. Maybe also see if there might be a minor that interests you and see what classes it would require. Never hurts to take your GEFs towards something.\n\nSo yeah I think it could be helpful to at least look at information and classes so you\u2019re not blindsided. It\u2019s your education after all. You don\u2019t need to worry about scheduling or anything but I def recommend taking a look.",

The limit is 21 I believe and they only had me taking 15 a semester starting out, which I understand, but freshman classes are way better to just finish all at once and get out of the way. It might seem overwhelming, but you'll thank me later, especially when you get into senior classes where some have limited seats and you have to wait to take them a different semester or if you decide to add a minor/change your major etc... \n\nAlso don't be afraid to take your time looking through the options, WVU has a great selection of classes geared towards GED requirements. If you need an easy course for science- I recommend geology 101, if you need an easy language class- I recommend either Spanish or Italian, and if you need a fun elective- I recommend the vampires class.",

Most of the faculty is great, and you get to develop a pretty good bond with a lot of your classmates. There\u2019s always something to do in it, too, so even if you\u2019re not working a MainStage production, you can find something to do if you really want to. \n\nThere\u2019s theatre courses in just about every discipline imaginable, but I\u2019d say the two areas WVU hits best at is the Musical Theatre and Design Tech programs. There\u2019s not really any clubs per say for theatre, but there is Theatre Student Organization, but not many people are involved with that. My advice would be if you\u2019re not wanting to do theatre as your main thing but still wanna take courses and work productions, get a minor in it.\n\nAs far as I\u2019m aware about film programs, WVU ain\u2019t got dick in that regard. There\u2019s a film club and a MultiMedia Studies program, but that\u2019s about it. I don\u2019t know shit about the media college, though, so there may be more to it than that.",

I graduated in 2019, in the 2nd ever class to graduate WVU with that major (it was an area of emphasis before). \n\nThe job market is pretty good. I am developmentally disabled so I had a very hard time finding a job. I ended up going back to WVU and did the Business Data Analytics Masters program, and found a group which would help me get my job. Now I make $93k as a data scientist for a big tech company, more than people who just had the Bachelors degree. Most of my colleagues from the GSCM program make around $60-70k at this time, about 4 years out. \n\nThe GSCM major is very hard. There is a lot of information to memorize. There are a lot of methodologies and formulas to figure out. It is sort of a combination between an engineering degree, a business management degree, and a computer science degree. Though at WVU, and pretty much every other college I've heard of, GSCM is a business degree. I've actually had people argue with me that GSCM is an engineering degree, and I was an engineering student. \n\nOn top of all that, WVU requires you to take Business Core classes, termed \"BCOR\" classes, meaning you'll get some exposure to the other aspects of the business school. This means you'll get classes in stuff like Finance, Marketing, and Accounting, which are not easy.  You won't get to supply-chain specific classes until Junior Year, so it will probably feel like you are never going to learn the stuff you came to WVU for. \n\nI don't mean to scare you. I just want to lay the facts out as they are. Looking back, I really grew a lot in my time at WVU, and I can't see majoring in anything else. Feel free to DM me if you want to know anything else about WVU or business in general",

        "body": "> I'm moving into West Run, and the reviews kind of scare me\n\nI used to live and work at West Run. I've also lived several other places around town - such as Copper Beech across the street.\n\nOne of the main differences with West Run vs Copper Beech or renting a house is that at West Run, you are only ever responsible for your own portion of the rent. Say you have a 2-bedroom apartment. You share the living space, kitchen, laundry - and you have your own bedroom and bathroom. Say you pay $600 a month. If your roommate stops paying rent, it makes no difference to you. Maybe they get evicted and nobody occupies the other bedroom. Doesn't affect you.\n\nAt Copper Beech (and same if you rent a house, obv), they advertise rents as per person, but the rent has to be paid via one check, and everyone is responsible for the rent. Roommate gets pissed off and moves home? The rest of you will get evicted if you don't make up her portion of the rent (for example).\n\nThis is extra risky when dealing with people you don't know. Just saying. 3 beds 1 bath with 3 people, especially girls, seems like a recipe for disaster.\n\nEdit: I guess there are two exceptions to the West Run thing - firstly, you will split any electrical usage overages. So if your roommate is mining bitcoin 24/7 and running up the electric bill, you'll be paying an even share of it. Secondly, when you both move out, if the common areas aren't clean and undamaged, you'll get charged on your deposit - even if none of it was your fault.",

Granted, buildings lower on the hill don't have that issue as often.\n\nAs for management, it's a tossup. It changed management companies 3 times while I was there. I'm sure it's changed multiple times more. Management is unlikely to help if you have issues with your roommate. Even if your rommate is smoking weed all day, management will tell you to just contact police - and police won't care.\n\nAs for noise, it's HIGHLY dependent upon who's in your building and which floor you're on. All building are 4 floors, with entrances on the first and second floors. I always tried to choose 4th floor units so that I wouldn't have anyone ABOVE me making noise. That having been said, the buildings are split into 4-bedroom buildings, and 2/3-bedroom buildings. The 4-bedroom buildings are more likely to be loud. Generally, however, if the unit above you isn't loud (or you are on the 4th floor), and the one unit RIGHT NEXT to you isn't loud (it's 4 units per floor, 2 per side), it's fine. There's an after hours number you can call to make a noise complaint if there's a party - and staff\\* WILL (or at least would 10 years ago) come out and tell the people to knock it off if you call.\n\nAsterisk on staff because when I was there, they gave free apartments to a couple of cops, under the deal that they were the after-hours security. So it could be a college-age staff member OR A COP who responds to noise complaints.\n\nThe biggest selling point of West Run is the bus access. The Mountain Line city bus stops right at the clubhouse area all the time. So if you value taking the bus (you can get to downtown campus faster than that 15 minute walk you were talking about), it's a good perk.\n\nGuest parking is separate and is often inadequate on weekends.

Everything else was a hodge podge. You talk a lot in the vans on the drive out to the camp site.\n\nIn experience, your trip weighs heavily on who your leaders are. Some are chill and some are not, mine weren't but that's a story for another time. Overall the trip was a good way to see the state and have friends before day 1 of classes.",

Like sophomore, junior, etc isn\u2019t really a thing in college because some people graduate in 3 years, 4 years, 5 years, or more. \n\nFor example, I had enough credits to classify as a senior for my last 2.5 years. It\u2019s not like high school where everyone graduates in 4 years and it\u2019s also not a race. Of course graduate as soon as possible but don\u2019t kill your self to make sure you meet 3 or 4 years.\n\nSo to answer your question, no, there\u2019s nothing that says a freshman couldn\u2019t take a 200 level class. When you\u2019re scheduling you\u2019ll see the pre-reqs. Some may require you to have taken so many credit hours before the class but most will require a series of classes. \n\nMy advice, take it easier your first semester. College can be a lot to adjust to. After that semester you\u2019ll find out if you can handle more or if it was too easy for you. I\u2019d prob take like maximum 18 credits if I was in your situation.",

School financial aid year is (fall-summer semester so technically this school year isn\u2019t over yet).\n\nI had this same exact thing happen to me except I started in the fall. I had like a 1.8 in the spring semester but retained my aid. When i didn\u2019t get it up by the next fall, that is when I officially lost it. So I did have 1 semester below a 2.0 but It was technically the same school year. That\u2019s why I\u2019m not sure how your situation works.\n\nIf you get below a 2.0, you can\u2019t even apply for federal or sometimes private loans.

        "body": "WVU is full of jersey kids. If you can't handle that, find another school.\n\nEDIT:  Since I'm a loser, allow me to expand on this. I'm an alum. Class of 2012, actually. During my 4 years at WVU, according to data published by WVU and reported in the DA, 40% or more of WVU students in those years were from outside the state of West Virginia. Public universities tend to have lower numbers than that. Consistently, only about 60% of college students at West Virginia higher ed institutions are state residents. \n\nFurther, the abundance of nonresidents from New Jersey is well enough known to be somewhat of a joke around Morgantown. I once saw tshirts at a football game, old gold and royal blue, bearing the state seal of West Virginia and the words, \"New Jersey State University Morgantown Campus\". According to collegefactual.com, more than 5% of WVU's undergraduate students were from New Jersey (and fewer thsn 50% from West Virginia), making it the largest contributor of undergraduates among states that do not border West Virginia. This from their 2021 diversity report. \n\nNow, if it's \"toxic\" to point out that 1 in 20 WVU undergrads is a NJ resident, less thsn every other is a WV resident, that NJ resident students are a long established fact of life at WVU, and that if it's a problem then that problem is best avoided by enrolling elsewhere, then I'm one toxic motherfucker. \n\nBefore y'all go accusing anyone of talking shit on jersey, I'm gonna point out that I'm originally from there as well and I'll talk all the shit I want to about that place. I'm not talking shit. But if I want to, I will. I'm sure there's a more appropriate subreddit for that. If not, there's about to be. \n\nThis isn't a recent development. For a long time, WVU has had relatively cheap out-of-state tuition. Access to transit for the holidays is available at WVU, so folks all over the northeast and mid-atlantic can get home in an easy day's travel. It made WVU ideal for students in New Jersey (and until recently, New York too), who could pay pennies on the dollar versus the likes of Rutgers. WVU has been happy to have that out-of-state money flowing in to spend on ... I dunno, running the Sunnyside Superette out of business? Stuff. Fuck it. They're spending it all on STUFF. For that above-average rate of out-of-state enrollment, WVU has built new facilities of all sorts, advanced to a R1 research institution, and continued to kick everyone's ass with its nationally dominant Rifle team. (Actually that may have less to do with New Jersey.  I'm not really sure.)\n\nIn many ways it's a good thing to have all these New Jersey students. WVU is in many ways not very diverse at all, and West Virginia is pretty much the opposite of diverse. So bringing in more people who know that, \"No, dear, they are NOT made of chocolate, and it's not nice to say that\", is a good thing. Bringing in all that extra revenue from higher nonresident tuition, is a good thing (even if WVU's staff are some of the lowest-paid workers in the region still). \n\nTL;DR- if jersey guys in the gym is a problem, then WVU is not the place for you.",

Power through the hangover or sleep deprivation, you never know if the professor will give out bonus points for low attendance, give out a pop quiz or give out some key information on assignments or exams. Just because your friends are going out doesn't mean you have to, focus on your classes. My rule was get class work done then go have fun. Schedule classes, if you can, after 10 am. Find out if youre a morning person in college, dont assume you are because you woke up early in highschool. Its 10x harder to find out youre not a morning person with 8am classes. WVU isn't a big school but its spread out, find out where your class buildings are and figure out how long it takes to walk or ride to. Learn to budget, you might think $2K+ is a lot of money but its extremely easy to blow in less than a month.",

It is usually quicker than taking the bus or the PRT at busy times. I gained a lot of weight since I stopped doing this walk every day. \n\nGo to the football games. They are one of the only things I miss about college. I wasn't into basketball, but if you are, go to the games. \n\nDuring football and basketball games, the referees will always make calls against WVU. The announcers on TV will always be in favor of the other team. This is because the Big 12 would much prefer WVU not be in it. Just accept it. \n\nNormally I'd say you don't need a car. I didn't. However, transit options are not what they used to be, and every situation is different. But Morgantown is a walkable city. I could walk or take public transit almost anywhere, and there were options to take transit home.\n\nIf you do have a car, don't get a DUI. An uber is a thousand times cheaper (sometimes literally) than a DUI. \n\nIf you're drinking underage, don't be loud. I don't know a single person who got an underage who wasn't acting loud and obnoxious at the time they got it (example, one guy I know got an underage because he looked at a cop and yelled \"f*** the police!\"). \n\nDon't burn anything. Despite what ESPN says, couch burning is a thing of the past. I went 4 years without seeing one, or even hearing about it. I did hear about one couch being burned once and it was a big enough deal to get its own press conference. \n\nSpeaking of ESPN, they will say \"Morgantown, Virginia\" or something to that effect, at least once a game if you're watching it on TV. This is just something you'll have to accept. \n\nMore people in the US don't know that West Virginia is a state than you might think. You will probably meet someone who didn't know West Virginia was a state until their first day on campus. And several people back home will not know either. This is something else to accept. \n\nThe name of the school is West Virginia University. There is no University of West Virginia. This is not something to accept. It is a bigger deal than most people think.\n\nGet a pair of black sneakers. They are much easier on your feet than dress shoes. I was a business student, so I had events I would have to dress up for. I would put my dress shoes in my backpack and put them on when I got to the event, and I could just wear my sneakers otherwise. \n\nBlack coffee is better for you, and makes you feel better, than Monster. \n\nWhen you are in your first year seminar class (BCOR 199 for me), they will come around and tell you about the different majors within your college. They will make it sound like their program is the only good one in all of WVU, and you will end up a homeless bum if you don't major in their major. That isn't true. \n\nAnd finally, you're just starting out. You're going to feel like graduation day is a thousand years away. There are going to be times when it will really suck. But the day will come when you're sitting in the Coliseum, hearing them sing Simple Gifts. Hearing that song after I had gotten my diploma after 4 hard years is still one of my most moving memories. Just remember, and repeat to yourself, that day will come.",

If you end up wanting to pursue a bachelors, definitely go for it. I had a great time at WVU, just wish I would have been more mature in the beginning. I messed up my grades by not going to class, really easy to do. Try your hardest to end your first year with a high GPA. It\u2019s much harder to bring it up than it is to push it down. If you start strong, you have a cushion for that one class you really struggled in. Also take advantage of the D/F repeat option, if you happen to do poorly in a class. Utilize rate my professor, professors will make or break a class. College can be really stressful at times, so make sure you\u2019re taking care of yourself too. Seriously try to form relationships with professors in upper level classes. ESPECIALLY if you want to go to grad school. You will need those references and recommendations. I wish someone told me that, I would like to pursue grad school one day, but not having those references makes it much harder. Overall, it\u2019s a great time. You\u2019ll make lifelong friends, do crazy stuff together, be there to support each other, and even learn a thing or two. College isn\u2019t for everyone and that is totally ok. Don\u2019t let anyone force you or talk you into it. If you know in your gut you want to go, then do it. Don\u2019t go if you\u2019re not totally committed to it.

Verizon works great in town and along major interstates, but they are lacking in spectrum in WV. US Cellular will get you service in the boonies as well, but their network isn't the fastest. T-Mobile is improving greatly since they bought sprint and later Shentel Wireless (a partner of sprint who ran their network in WV). But, word of warning. When town is extremely busy, especially around the football stadium, all the cell networks get extremely congested. The only thing that will work reliably is voice calls. Data is unusable UNLESS you pay for one of the highest end unlimited plans from ATT, Verizon, etc. These are single line postpaid plans that run about $85-$100 a month for a single line. You are also going to want a newer phone down here, at least the iPhone 11/12 or a S20, or newer, just because of the terrain in WV. You want a phone with a good modem. However, if you don't care about having your phone work on gamedays in the stadium, any plan will work fine. \n\nI recognize this is way more in depth than what you asked for, but it's good to know for everyone.",

Also, Stalnaker is newly renovated and the rooms are a comfortable size/private bathroom with your roommate & suitemate. Its also right in the middle of downtown so you\u2019re within a good walking distance of the library/mountainlair/class buildings. I\u2019d avoid Dadisman,Summit, & Boreman if you\u2019re living downtown just because of the overall cleanliness and communal bathrooms. If you\u2019re thinking of living in Evansdale, all dorms are great options. Towers would connect you to the most people and the dining hall is great. Lincoln is mostly honors but the rooms are very upkept. Oakland is a little further away but its also very new and maintained well.  \n\nPersonal bias: Stalnaker all the way. I recommend this to all new students. It\u2019s the perfect combination of relaxed but also weekend friendly. Out of every dorm I\u2019ve seen, it\u2019s the most well kept and cleanest. It\u2019s super diverse with the 2nd floor international students and the 4th floor LGBT+ students. It\u2019s also very convenient for any downtown class and even evansdale classes with the PRT being a 5 minute walk away. \n*the prt is a free student transit that takes you to both campus\u2019s*",

There was a raw chicken incident at one of our dining halls, so to rectify it they decided to precook all chicken and freeze it.  Then they reheat it.  You can imagine how good reheated chicken would be.  So, instead of teaching their staff how to properly cook chicken, they decided this would be a better option.  And I've had students tell me they've had pieces of frozen (but fully cooked) chicken in their meals instead.  \n\nThe problem is that universities sign large contracts with these companies that guarantee them a certain amount of profits.  This is why some universities require students to have meal plans to meet this quota.  Unless there is some measure in the contract to keep quality up, why would the company sacrifice guaranteed profits to spend more on training, food quality, etc.  Especially when students are forced to pay for it anyway.",

I\u2019ll be at the game in September, the last time I was there for the backyard brawl in 2010 there were more WVU fans than pitt fans, and even with pitts season last year I look for that to happen again.",

The actual course content isn\u2019t too bad if you\u2019ve taken CHEM 115 and 116. The content is actually pretty similar. The biggest thing about that class is that units and significant figures are extremely important to the grade. You would get 50% points off of a correct answer if those two things were off. The labs were also pretty intense. It\u2019s important to have proper time management in that lab because some of the experiments can take multiple labs to complete. It was self guided which can be a good or bad thing. The lab was also the first chemistry class I took that graded you on your %yield and standard deviation lf your three trials for each experiment as well. Most people didn\u2019t easily get high grades in the lab portion. All in all I wouldn\u2019t say the class was hard, but it\u2019s something you have to be on top of and be very meticulous about because mistakes can cost you a lot in that class. Hope this helps",

The scenarios were always really difficult for me. Most of them feel like they come out of left field and you have no idea how what we learned relates. However, Dana Hubert Lima at least offers a shit ton of extra credit which if you do it will help your grade immensely. The homework is also all at your own pace so you don\u2019t have to do it every week. There\u2019s different assignments worth a different amount of points and once you reach the max points you don\u2019t have to do anymore. Weekly quizzes also add towards the homework grade so you don\u2019t never have to do any quizzes if you don\u2019t want to. The content is also fast paced so you have to keep up with your studying or the exams will kill you. If you do take this class I recommend making a shit ton of flow charts for how everything relates in a scenario of your choosing. (Ex: rapunzels hair glows now what molecularly could cause that.)  The 220 lab is super easy though if you have to take the lab.",

Someone else commented about an adventure group - if it\u2019s about exploring the outdoors, join it! There\u2019s all kinds of hiking, climbing/rappelling, and water areas. Be a shame not to do those.  It wasn\u2019t there when I went so we found stuff ourselves. \n\nWhile the only time I ever saw real backups on the interstates were game days and accidents, you will not even notice if you have spent any amount of time whatsoever on 270, any single inch of it in mont cty, ya feel me? Univ ave will occasionally give you a 355 vibe, minus half the lanes. All this to say about a million less people but all of em are in a smaller area. \n\nI can\u2019t speak to how urban Morgantown is now tho, I graduated 20 years ago. Last time I was up there I took someone to the hosp and it\u2019s grown a lot - even has a target now lol. \n\nOne major con: they do not have crisp n juicy. Or Trader Joe\u2019s. But you\u2019re only 3 hrs from home and you will soooo be going the \u201cright\u201d ways on fri and sunday. \n\n\n\nUniv internships etc:\n\nFor me? Great. I worked at the labs, and made my way up to eventually working full time at WVU for a few years after graduating. Really my whole career was based on how that went (before farming hahah). I did NOT find my way academically there tho. Barely graduated. I don\u2019t blame that on the school tho, I transferred in 3rd year after my dad died. I don\u2019t recommend getting too much into partying lol but I understand that\u2019s calmed down. Age and hindsight I\u2019d have done things differently, so sorry, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m the best advice on this. But the  people on the administrative side that I worked for really helped me out. And I lucked in to a couple really excellent professors. My husband got the dual computer and electrical engineering degree and he interned down at nasa then was recruited to Lockheed (I think they just tore his site old down there at mon village ave & 355) So there\u2019s opportunities! But it\u2019s gonna be ymmv. \n\nHope I helped with my 20 years outdated info lol.",

        "body": "If you're a girl, do college park. In Vandalia, I had a guy from maintenance just straight up key into my living room and then bedroom when I didn't have a work order in and without knocking/notice. He had no tools with him, no one else from maintenance with him, etc. I also lost half of my Nintendo switch game collection when I went home for Christmas break. I thought I lost them at first until I MOVED ENTIRE APARTMENTS and they still never turned up. Expect that when Vandalia makes a mistake, no one's gonna care, but if you slightly deviate from lease rules- the entire staff is out to get you. This semester I actually changed my renew form from yes to no. I had that man in my room for no reason, told Vandalia, they did nothing about it. I had to contact the higher ups of the maintenance department, they told me they'd take action, and I still see the guy everywhere. But then, I had my boyfriend over like a night a week, then all of the sudden I get an email about 'guest violation'. Claimed that I was violating my lease, etc. For shits and giggles, I pulled up my copy of the lease- there is absolutely nothing about guest limits in the lease that I signed. After that, I was done. Also, paying for laundry is ridiculous when rent is 600+ a month. At west run, rent is 350 a month and they get a washer/dryer in their unit and a POOL. There's no reason for Vandalia to simultaneously be so expensive and so shitty. They claim to have all these amenities like a gym, pet friendly, etc- but they keep switching up every year. The gym is really just 3 pieces of gym equipment thrown into the corner of the room. And now we don't even have that because maintenance has been using it as a storage playground for the past year. They were pet friendly up until this semester, they even built a dog park, and then all of the sudden pets are no longer allowed. this turned in to a crazy long vent, but if you can, go with college park. Honestly, if you ask me, you might be better off looking outside of university apartments all together. They tend to be cheaper and less involved- which is a double win. If not, definitely go with college park.",

They have a whole program dedicated to it, Adventure WVU \nhttps://adventurewv.wvu.edu\nThey take trips, do gear rental and much more. Many people recommend taking a first year trip to get to see the state and make friends before you even take your first class. You\u2019re also out here in the mountains and have plenty to do on your own or with friends.\n\nAs for research, WVU is an R1 research institute just like Ohio State and has a plethora of research opportunities. Most students who want to do research will have the opportunity to do research. Me and my gf are actually both going to be published before we graduate. I\u2019ll link some of the programs below, but you can also find opportunities by just asking around and communicating with professors and advisors. \nhttps://undergraduateresearch.wvu.edu\nhttps://www.honors.wvu.edu/academics/honors-excel-program\n\nHonestly, I love WVU and coming here is the best decision I\u2019ve ever made. I fell in love with it on my first visit because of the community. The pride that the entire state has in the mountaineers is unmatched. Come visit and you\u2019ll understand what I mean. \n\nAlso, if you\u2019re into sports or not you have to make the games, our student section and fans are some of the best (or worst if you\u2019re on the other team) and it\u2019s an absolutely electric environment. We also have the best tradition in all of sports, singing country roads after a win.\n\nIf you have any other questions feel free to shoot me a message.",

When people heard I was going to WVU they often said something like \"You'll be right at home then, out in the woods!\" \n\nIt seemed like people thought WVU was a cabin in the woods somewhere. It isn't. There are a lot of things there which are similar to any other college. However, I've seen the OSU campus and it is definitely more depressing. \n\nYou can drive a bit and get to wilderness areas, but if you don't have a car (I didn't), you're a bit limited. We have the Mon river right next to campus. It has woods alongside it, including the arboretum up near the coliseum. There are trails there and other trails that go around campus. That's about it. \n\nEveryone talks about the New River Gorge (like the giant bridge) but that is further away than people think it is. People do organize trips to other places, like skiing. \n\nI think you'll love WVU. The math department is incredible, and I loved my professors I had in there. The sunsets are amazing. The people are friendly. Football games are one of the highlights of the year. I'm not trying to scare you away with my descriptions of the campus. I just want to make sure you know that it isn't everything people think it is. \n\nWhy did I choose WVU? Well, based on my grades and my college fund, and its relative closeness to my hometown, it kinda worked out. My best friend from high school also went there with me. I loved the campus culture and how everyone was, and I got a better education than I thought I would. That's why I stuck it out, and chose to go back for a masters. Now I work as a data scientist for a major tech company. \n\nI think you'll love it there. Let me know if you're going to visit. I may make a campus visit and buy you a beer.",

These are typically taken before most students are even accepted into the program to make sure you can keep up once you start taking nursing specific classes which are very demanding. The entirety of nursing school was very difficult and for sure tested everyone in my class (myself included). However, there is a tangible difference in ability for WVU new grads compared to other schools. The schooling is very hard because nursing is very hard, even more so as a new grad. Yes it sucks, but it will really pay off when you get that first job. \n\nBest tips I can give you are to stay focused, find a group of dedicated friends to study with and maintain balance. The school provides the resources you need to succeed but you will still need to stay in some weekends to study for exams, that doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t go out and enjoy all the great things WVU has to offer.",

They also have a surprising amount of amenities. It's super easy to sign up and I'm pretty sure they have a program thing with WVU. \n\nI also believe that they just merged with Fairmont so they will probs be offering a lot more classes.",

        "body": "Ramble incoming. It might not all be interesting to you, but I word vomited it up so it's staying. \n\nThere are a lot of decent places to rent in South Park. It is where a lot of grad students and professors live. It is quieter, not much of a party scene, but you will have some people that still get together on weekends. Most of these residences will have parking for your car if you drive down, so you wouldn't need to rely on the bus to get groceries. It is possible, but not ideal, to get to Wal-Mart and other groceries via bus if you don't bring a car. Unfortunately, the closest large airport is Pittsburgh, and I don't know where the Morgantown airport flies to. \n\nA lot of South Park is walking distance to campus, but there's also the mountainline bus that comes through. It is probably better if your classes are timed well for it, unless you enjoy walking.  It takes a little longer to bus than walk, but you exert less effort, so it is based on preference. I did both when I lived there, depending on time of day. \n\nThere's also the PRT, but I used that only for going between Downtown and Evansdale campuses. There's a third stop (Walnut?) but I know nothing about it. Since you'd be primarily downtown, I expect your usage would be mostly related to sports, ie getting to evansdale.  As a grad student, you would still qualify for student section tickets. Free, but through a raffle for football and first come first served for basketball (at least when I was there). Most of the other sports you could pretty much just flash your student ID and get in. \n\nI did not attend WVU as a grad student, but did know many as I worked as an undergraduate TA. Most of the offices are in the same buildings as related classes, divided up by departments. There is a library on each campus with a cafe, and tons of study rooms available to reserve. I used these for my infrequent office hours as a TA since I personally didn't have an office.   In the chemistry department, the grad students had a lot of research lab hours and/or TA hours, so they spent most of the day in one or two buildings. Not sure what your schedule looks like, but you'll likely be in a similar position. Packed lunches did well for me, but there's the MountainLair in the center of downtown campus that has multiple food joints and a lot of restaurants on high street. \n\nI'm not sure what else you'd be interested in knowing, but there will be a lot of people in a similar position.  Even if you don't know anyone coming from NY, there will be a lot of people starting fresh who would be happy to figure this out with you.",

You\u2019d want to live with in walking distance to downtown to make sure you can alway get places, especially at night or on the weekends. PRT will get you from campus to campus but it primarily functions during school hours. (Closes at 10 & on school holidays).

Ubers & zip cars exist here too if you need to get somewhere in a pinch. \n\nA car makes it way easier to enjoy WV. Lots of outdoors to explore if you can get there.

Furthermore if your taking the honors version you would get a much much smaller class size and better professor interaction - which can be very helpful as chem 115 and 116 involves a lot of difficult topics for a lot of people. Although the last point applies to any honors version of a course.

The football stadium is on the Evansdale campus and the dorms on the Evansdale campus are less of a party area than the downtown campus. It might make you and your parents feel better if you chose to live on Evansdale campus your first year.  I believe there's also an LLC in the towers for athletes where you can live on one floor with just athletes but I'm not sure about that and you'd have to reach out to housing website.\n\nOne other tidbit... You are the student and you are the one who's going to have to get the education and smart making smart decisions for yourself. Do not let your parents make the decision of where you go to college; this is something that you have to do for yourself because if you choose a different school and it doesn't work out you will resent your parents. If you choose WVU and it works out then you should be very proud of yourself but no student should allow their parents to make the decision of what college to go to. It's all about starting your adult life with your own decisions.  Yes, your parents can help guide you but they cannot make that decision for you",

I spent many late nights working on projects.  I worked a part-time IT job whenever I wasn't in class.  I occasionally tutored other students in the evenings (in exchange for beer.)  One or two of my years, I had enough time in between classes to walk down from the engineering building to Panera for lunch.\n\n...and then I partied HARD on the weekends.  We're talking full-on classic WVU debauchery.  Frankly, I'm still not quite sure how we all survived it.\n\nMy hobbies in college included brewing beer, backpacking, and canoeing, all of which I did quite frequently.  I also kept a nice garden in my back yard for a few years, before they bulldozed most of Sunnyside.\n\nHonestly, given all of that, it wasn't particularly stressful until my senior year, when the 400-level CS classes got legitimately hard.\n\nBut to your point, I basically only had weekends free.

It extremely tempting to look at the average pharmacist salary, and apply for it, but don\u2019t. The industry is completely fucked. Current pharmacist salaries are high due to a shortage created in the early 90s when the degree went from being 5 years to a graduate degree. The number of pharmacist schools also quadrupled since that time, while the number of jobs have gone down. \n\nThe only jobs you will be able to find will be retail, and it\u2019s as close to hell on earth as you can get. The stress of not trying to kill someone, with the banalities of dealing with the public, and insurance companies, and whatever new thing your company wants you to do (the fact that my parents give people shots terrified me, because they were never trained how to properly do it). If you FIND a job, your wages will also be about half of what the current average is. Working conditions are also shit, and they never hire enough help, or keep enough people in the store, in order to safely and effectively run a pharmacy. \n\nSo, yeah. I realize I\u2019m a bit late to this post, but hope I was able to give some good perspective anyways.",

One also has to consider there's only around a 55% chance a student will match with a residency at all. Say a new grad chooses to go into retail in order to get more work experience. Then they try to apply to hospital jobs but aren't hired because they don't have residency training/board certifications that they can't even sit for because they haven't been working in a job that consists of > 50% clinical work. I only know of a few people who have gotten hospital jobs right after graduating, but now they're stuck living in BFE.\n\nNow for those going into retail you realize that pharmacist hours and pay have gone down dramatically over the last 10 years. While that's happened, and especially during the COVID era, the expectations for pharmacists to do extra tasks like keep up both COVID and non-COVID vaccinations and testing has only gone up. The technicians are also grossly underpaid and this leaves a lot of pharmacies short staffed. Burnout has been rough the last few years and pharmacists are quitting to pursue jobs outside of the field altogether. Want to own your own pharmacy instead? Good luck competing with the big chains while getting dicked by poor reimbursement rates for prescriptions.\n\nAnd you might think that if all these people are quitting, there must be lots of jobs right? Well there are too many degree mill pharmacy schools that have basically no admission requirements and only exist to pump out under-qualified new grads who are all fighting for the same jobs. This leads to an endless supply of \"floaters\" working part time since the chains won't hire more full time pharmacists.",

There's a lot of the long time dining services staff that were relegated to lesser duties from leadership positions, and had no say in how the dining halls were run.

So what if there's more freshmen and sophomores than Juniors and seniors but at least you'll get to meet people. Based on your preferences, my recommendation would be to look at the dorms and see what might interest you the most. Are you a Suburban type of kid or are you a city kind of kid? If you are more Suburban, choose Evansdale if you're more of a city kid choose downtown because there's a lot more activity, partying, music and drama.  Are you the type of kid who wouldn't mind living and sharing a bathroom with 35 kids on the floor or would you prefer your own private bathroom sharing with only three or four? Do you want to have a dining hall in your building or have to walk a little bit to get to one? Are you going to be able to survive during the summer months without air conditioning? These are things you need to consider so go to the housing website to see what dorms you should keep or cross off your list. Best of luck to you, oh yes, and consider getting a part-time job or joining a social group or activity to meet more people.",

There would be less people to meet and if you find people off facebook to live with, just hope and pray yall get along.\n\nOverall, the best way to meet people is by going out and being around campus. Go to the gym, join clubs, socialize downtown. Maybe even rush, if that's your thing.\n\nHope this was helpful in some way.",

Go to the housing website and look at the descriptions of the dorms. Some don't have air conditioning... Could you see yourself living in a dorm that reaches 90\u00b0 because it doesn't have AC? Some dorms have private bathrooms and some have Community bathrooms? Could you see yourself living in a bathroom with six showers and 6 sinks sharing with other people? Some don't have elevators and some don't have dining Halls. Some are very social because there's lots of people in it and you will make many friends while some have smaller hallways and you may not meet a lot of people. These are things to consider also besides just a general location.  Downtown can be a very loud area with frat houses nearby and cars driving up and down the streets often. Evansdale campus is very Suburban like with not as much noise and more Greenery.  Also don't forget to do a search through this sub to see all the different things that people have already posted about the different dorms, campuses, dining Halls, Etc",

HIGHLY recommend it as not only do you live with people who you have things in common with but you have an instant social group your freshman year with other freshman. My student loved it.

There really is no difference between the four as they are all the same rooms sizes Etc and they are all connected with the lobby, each other, and the dining hall. It's nice being on the Evansdale campus because it's a quieter community and very Suburban like where downtown is not.  Yes, Lyons was closed to students  this year.  You wouldn't want to live there anyway because many rooms overlook the trash cans, loading docks, and Loud trucks in the morning. Oh, one more thing, may I recommend that you try and get to overlook the soccer fields?  Rooms that end in 04 through 10 face that way, no matter what floor u are on.",

        "body": "Tips:\n\n1. Flip-flops for the shower - don't go barefoot (I thought this was a \"duh\" but some need told)\n2. If you hook up with students on the same floor and it doesn't work out, it gets awkward. If you don't get involved, prepare for gossip, which is fun when it isn't you. Definitely make friends with people on your floor, though.\n3. Try bunking your beds and investing in a cheap futon and a decent TV - your room will become the floor hangout where you can make a lot of friends. If you're opposed to that, then avoid this approach.\n4. Invest in a humidifier - I said this above but the air gets so dry in those towers in the winter that it wreaks havoc on your sinuses.\n5. Be used to the elevators going on the fritz and using your stairwell. It helps you get used to all the stairs on campus, too!\n6. If you get with a roommate and they're a slacker, do your best to avoid their bad habits. It is very easy to lose focus on why you're there if you constantly have to deal with someone who doesn't take it seriously.\n7. Don't be afraid to see who on your floor may have similar classes/activities as you do. They make this push to have everyone \"get to know you\" but go the extra step. Keeping in with a committed crowd keeps you focused as long as you don't overdo it on extracurriculars.\n8. Finally, as if this wasn't a known already, get used to waking up at a set time every day. It doesn't matter if you don't have class on Thursday until 1, you can wait to sleep in on the weekends. It's incredibly difficult to get up for your early morning class if you're sleeping in on alternate days.\n\nGood luck!",

The house parties that still go on now are more just people who know each other rather than the block party ragers we used to have. \n\nThe frat parties are usually a big deal but they have not been as wild since covid. They are pretty strict unless you are close friends with a brother. \n\nI am 21 now so I go to the bars. The majority of the bars are strictly 21+ but there are a few clubs that are 18+ (code, blaze, pryzm, the bank).  Code is pretty much always crowded on the weekends and is the place to go for someone under 21. Blaze and pryzm are not bad either but The Bank kind of sucks. \n\nSo all in all, I would saying going out downtown is the best option right now. I know it all sounds kind of lame, but it is still a really fun, social school and as long as you can make a friend or a few, you will always be able to find something to do. \n\nHope this helps and good luck!",

They are outside the City and the traffic out that way into town isn't the best.\n2. They have shuttles (or some do, anyway), but it is still wise to plan your trip as if you needed to drive yourself.\n3. Pay attention to reviews - most places whitewash the poor reviews but if you ask around on campus (not just Reddit), you'll know a couple (i.e. The Lofts, for example) are ones you need to stay away from at all costs.\n4. Maintenance varies from complex to complex. Some answer right away, some you may be a few days with something broken.\n5. Laundry is an unknown, but there are laundromats around town if you need.\n\nThat said, Evansdale isn't bad if you find a house in the $1,200-$1,500/month range. You will all but assuredly be paying for utilities in that scenario, though. Most landlords have abandoned \"utilities included.\"\n\nFinally, be sure to read your lease agreement front to back. Know what you are getting yourselves into. If you are rooming with others, be sure they understand their commitments. I've lived through the gauntlet of shitty places and shittier roommates - not a thing I'd have anyone live through.\n\nHappy hunting!",

I just used my car to go to the store, to de-stress while I drive around, and to drive home and not have to bug my parents about driving me or taking the train. My parking pass was the cheapest available on evansdale at $260 for the year and I think it was a great investment. If you have a nicer car you'll want to go for a nicer parking spot, but I have a 2004 ford and I've had 0 problems parking in the cheapest lot. It's nice to have as an option. If you find yourself driving your friends around a lot, try to work out a deal with them. Maybe them paying for food when you go somewhere, or just straight up paying for some gas, because it isn't cheap. Especially if you don't have a job.\nEdit: Also, if you are getting a parking spot on campus, try and get it as early as possible before they run out.",

When I was at WVU I did the grad certificate in university teaching (huge recommend to anyone in grad school there with professor aspirations). I took a higher Ed politics class as party of that and the prof was brand new. He did a whole unit on what a shit president Gee is lol. \n\nBut his vision for higher Ed is really bad for other WV colleges too. He would like WVU and Marshall to be the only 2 colleges in the state with branches all over like Penn State has. That type of monopoly isn\u2019t good for any state.",

        "body": "The problem with the intersection of University and Falling Run Road (Vandalia Hall's street) is the poor lines-of-sight for vehicles. The signals and rumble strips help but 90% of the cars going through there are intent on beating any signal that gets lit up, and that's only if the pedestrian activates the signal. If you cross without activating the signal, expect any oncoming car to not pay attention to you until the last possible second, because they flat out will not see you in front of them due to the curve. Short of a stoplight or roundabout that forces cars to slow down or stop, nothing much is going to change at that intersection.\n\nMy advice? Get active with local politics. Morgantown has a Traffic Commission, Pedestrian Safety Board, and even City Council meetings where the public can bring up these concerns. Even as a student, you are able to air your issues. As much as people have complained about traffic through Grumbein's Island and University Avenue in general over the years, it doesn't come up nearly enough at these meetings to push any substantive effort for change.\n\nAt the end of the day, people on foot or in a car need to start paying better attention.",

I personally think stoplights should be put in some places and even though it\u2019s cringey, there needs to be crossing guards on duty for heavily trafficked crossing areas such as by the Mountainlair",

If you are walking from the lair to across the street, why would you take a right, walk 50 -100ft, cross a street to get to Ming, and walk another 100-200 feet to go across the bridge when it\u2019s easier to just walk 50ft and cross the street. That\u2019s where the bridge should be. Have it be pretty, short and stubby,  made out of brick, wvu colors, wide so flow of pedestrian traffic can go both ways. It may make that area look nicer, it would almost immediately solve traffic problems there and be safer for students. \n\nYou\u2019re making an argument that humans are lazy and urban planning should just ignore that and say fuck pedestrians, fuck auto traffic, we built this bridge in a spot that\u2019s not where the majority of people walk and people will just have to deal with it. If that\u2019s your mentality, sure. No problems will be solved. If we could snap our fingers and make students go that route, it would solve all our problems. \n\nNow, there\u2019s other solutions that don\u2019t involve building another bridge. Perhaps there can be a light where students walk across at the lair. It comes on at busy times. Students have 30 seconds to cross, then they wait for 30 seconds and it\u2019s cars turn to go. Repeat that during busy times that students let are crossing there.",

I had a classmate staying in one of the towers who i was trying to help get through CS110, and his room looked EXACTLY THE FUCKING SAME as it did in 1990, now in 2008.

The ground floor is a common floor to all 4 towers, and you could walk past elevators to all 4 in under a minute without going outdoors or breaking a sweat.

The dining hall is the biggest in the university, and always has a ton of different options for food. The drink machines tend to run out of ice sometimes, but they\u2019re usually pretty good about it. \n\nIMO, the biggest perk of Towers is the Lyon\u2019s Den. It\u2019s essentially a convenience store on steroids. They have a hot kitchen with burgers, chicken tenders, pepperoni rolls, and hot subs and wraps. Joy, the manager, is the sweetest lady in the world and every time I talk to her, my day is brightened. It opens at 7pm and is open until 1am. If you want something from the kitchen, try to get there before 11:30. \n\nBut aside from that extremely drawn out tangent, I agree. If you choose to stay in towers, I would suggest either Braxton or Bennett. Braxton has a little bit closer access to the loop where buses come through, and Bennett is closer to the PRT station. Even from Braxton, it\u2019s only like a 5 minute walk. The communal restrooms are decent, however there is a lot of graffiti in the stalls. It\u2019s the typical kind of stuff you would expect college freshmen, but occasionally you\u2019ll get a chuckle out of them. The floors are by sex, so make only floors and female only floors. They are not consistent year to year, e.g. my floor was a women\u2019s floor last year, and you can still see the \u201cwo\u201d behind the paint above the bathrooms. \n\nFor Braxton, floors 5-9 are engineering Living Learning Communities. That essentially means those floors are only for engineering majors. If you\u2019re an engineer, it\u2019s more fun living with likeminded people.",

        "body": "**Very late and hefty response, but a lot of good info for anyone anxious about having Mingming as a professor.**\n\n I just took chem 115 this Fall; I registered late so my schedule ended up being made without my input. As soon as I got my schedule, I made sure look up each of my professors on RateMyProfessor. Mingming Xu was the only search that yielded concerning results. Since the public school system has already so generously gifted me with a myriad of my own personal evil-teacher horror stories, this worried me. \n\nBefore classes started, all honors students were required to attend the honors college retreat to meet other honors students and learn more about what the program entailed. Our mentors walked us around campus, filling us in on some of the basics regarding lecture halls, dorms, professors, etc. At some point one of the mentors stated, \"If any of you guys have Mingming for chem 115, I'm so sorry. I didn't have him, but I've heard he's a real hardass.\" The other mentor followed by mentioning she *did* in fact have Xu for chem, and confirmed the rumors to be true. \n\nOn the first day, I entered his class not entirely knowing what to expect, but bracing myself for the worst. He passed out his syllabus and began his introduction and I immediately realized why he was given said reputation; he was very straightforward and wasn't the warmest person. I could see how other students found him intimidating, but I personally respected his philosophy. During his introduction, I remember him saying something along the lines of, \n\n\"Forgetting your homework once is no big deal; I'll drop your lowest grade at the end of the semester. Although, if your don't turn your homework in for several weeks in a row, that tells me one of two things: Something happened (a family emergency, mental health crisis, etc.) that is preventing your ability to succeed academically, or you simply don't care about your grade in this class. And if *you* don't care about *your* grade, then why should I?\" \n\nFor reference, the workload consisted of a weekly 15-30 question homework quiz due Sunday at 11:59pm, a short 5-7 question quiz due the night after the first class of the week (except exam weeks), and the exams, so absolutely nothing crazy whatsoever. This does mean your grade is almost entirely based on exam scores, which can be stressful as his exams are notoriously difficult. However, if you attend class, pay attention, take notes, study, and put in a moderate amount of effort, you should be able to pass his exams. If you have a better than average knowledge of chem and/or are capable of absorbing substantial amounts of new information with relative ease, his homework assignments alone will be review enough for you.\n\nIn addition to the required assignments, he gives optional, but useful review material--weekly recitation worksheets with open-ended questions based on the material learned that particular week, a key with the corresponding fully worked out answers, and multiple-choice practice exams which are merely exams from previous years, and a key of the correct answer choices--that can greatly improve your chances of success when completed. The worksheets force you to attempt solving problems without the added comfort of answer choices, creating an opportunity for better understanding what you know versus any area(s) that may need improvement. They allow you to regularly assess your knowledge and understanding  throughout the course, granting plenty of additional opportunities to detect any areas in which you may still be lacking understanding. Since the practice exams are multiple-choice, it is more difficult to notice specific areas of weakness, however, they are CRUCIAL in familiarizing yourself with the format of his exam questions. English being his second language, test questions may be worded in an unclear or confusing manner. Becoming accustomed to his test structure will allow you to better understand what the question is specifically asking for/about, which will improve both confidence and efficiency. \n\nAs I mentioned before, many students claim his exams to be notably challenging. Before the midterm, he warned our section that over the years the class averages for this test have consistently landed somewhere between 45-60%. The week before the exam, I made sure to prioritize studying for chem over the rest of my classes, but as my schedule was extremely unforgiving, I didn't have time to study as much as I had originally intended to. Despite the lost study time, I scored a 94% without much difficulty. The next week he informed our section that our class average was a 70%, stating, \"I've been teaching chem 115 here for over a decade and this section's class average for the midterm has to be in the top three of all time.\" A class average of a C- being one of the highest sounds worrying, but it proves that by putting in the effort and preparing properly, success is well within reach. \n\nHe's a tough grader, a no-bullshit kind of guy, and doesn't like to waste time. This may make him appear cold or intimidating, but he is a genuinely understanding man. My first exam week, a combination of stress and overworking myself resulted in catching a nasty bug that left me bedridden for a week. I tend to run myself down in times of stress, making me more susceptible to sicknesses. I woke up that Monday morning with a high fever and feeling awful. While I didn't want to miss my chem exam, I knew that going to class would expose my peers and professors to sickness, and I wouldn't be capable of perform my best. I decided to stay home and attempt to recover as quickly as possible; Simply emailing my professors to inform them of circumstances regarding my absence left me remarkably fatigued, and confirmed that my choice to stay home was ideal. He responded with great understanding, allowed me to take the make-up exam, said that he too agreed staying home was for the best, and expressed that he admired my responsibility. Again, he respects those who respect him and he will be forgiving, as long as you demonstrate a willingness to work hard and a sense of academic responsibility. \n\nNow, this is all my experience, and it may differ for everyone. It seemed he liked our section, as we actively participated and respected his classroom rules. He would joke around with us, even on days he didn't feel well. However, I can clearly imagine how a less motivated class would result in a fate much worse.",

And painted ourselves. Got the carpets scrubbed. And they still charged us that. The carpet was garbage and stained to start. And I\u2019m pretty sure they charged the last tenant for carpet and just never replaced it. Which I believe is the same thing they are trying to do to us. They charged us cleaning and painting fees as well. Which we left the apartment cleaner than move in. And the paint was better too. The paint when we moved in was sloppy, all over the trim. And you could tel they don\u2019t patch nail holes. They just paint over them. All of their apartments are cheaply made. From the drywall, carpets, and light fixtures. To the appliances, closet doors, and bathroom utilities. Things break so often. Even if you are careful like me and my gf. Their maintenance is a joke. Even when they do come, it\u2019s a patch job at best. Hell, the people above us had a pipe break. It leaked down into our apartment. Spraying water out of the smoke detectors(still don\u2019t know how or why that\u2019s possible) and we never were given new ones. And god forbid you have a problem with one of their office staff who lives in a near by apartment. One girl was just letting her dog shit in the parking lot. Leaving it. And when I reported it multiple times. They did nothing, and started asking questions about my service dog. Who\u2019s has papers through the VA. Which they just decided to lose said papers twice. Then called me and knocked on my door for weeks telling me to get them another copy or I\u2019d owe back rent for my dog. Terrible company. Terrible management. So yeah. Avoid them like the plague.

The best bar is 21 and up (Joe Mamas) which I know you said you don\u2019t like partying but I think Joes and bars in general are a much different vibe than a house party. Something to consider. Plus even sober you can have a good time if that\u2019s not your thing!\n\nIf you\u2019re not from WV, Morgantown is a small town with 30-40000 people when school is in session so while it may not have that much to do do relative to a school in a bigger city, there\u2019s always people out doing things. \n\nIf you like nature than WV in general amazing. If you get a chance to go to the southern part of the state (Webster County is especially beautiful) than it\u2019s worth it. Rolling hills and valleys with beautiful streams. \n\nAcademics wise, it\u2019s pretty average. I would say the name recognition is pretty good so that helps. Now, if you factor in the cost, even for out of state, it\u2019s an amazing bang for your buck school. This is mainly due that the school has to stay accessible for its residents, (WV has awful public schools and most grow up poor).\n\nIf you can get into the Honors program those dorms (Lincoln Hall and Honors Hall) are much better than most of the dorms on campus. Also there\u2019s a lot less issues in the honors dorms. \n\nI know this was kinda everywhere but hope this helps. Feel free to ask questions. I graduated last year from the engineering program and grew up in North Central WV so I know the surrounding area fairly well.",

For the downtown campus, I definitely wouldn\u2019t go too far down high street without a group of friends, especially later in the day. There is a significantly high homeless population that will probably harass you if they can single you out. I know all of my female friends would only really go down there in groups. The actual campus buildings are pretty safe, there are those emergency contact poles everywhere that seem to be a pretty good deterrent. \n\nAll of this is coming from someone that just graduated last spring.

There are also so many people here from so many different places, you will find friends that have the same interests as you so you won't feel like an outcast. As far as safety goes I would give Morgantown a 9/10. Of course everyone has their own experiences and opinions, but personally, I have never felt unsafe on campus as a petite female, just use good judgement and surround yourself with the right people.

If you don't like it, or learn to not like it, it can often feel like the professors don't care, and that there are things that they can do to make it needlessly hard. However, I know many people who really love the engineering college, I was just not one of them. It's very structured, not too creative, and a  little confusing at times, but if it works for you, then usually you'll find success. One piece of advice I have, don't be afraid to fail. Failure is inevitable (in my opinion), whether that's one exam or a whole class. Sometimes you give it your all and it just can't meet what is needed, that's okay, but don't let it discourage  you. Keep your chin up, learn from your failures, and keep going. Also if you learn to really hate engineering, do not be afraid to leave engineering. It's better to spend more time in college than be a miserable shell of a person working long hours in a field you hate. Best of luck! (And if you've been accepted into/been offered to join honors, DM me, the university doesn't do a great job explaining what it is, and why you should do it, because it's totally worth it.)",

In my opinion, it's totally worth it. Unlike high school honors, honors at WVU basically gives you access to more classes, and honors addons/sections for your non-honors classes. Honors has in my opinion all of the benefits with very few drawbacks. Generally the Honors classes are fun, and not too challenging above what a normal class would be, Honors sections usually add one end of the semester project that you must complete (usually this project is challenging, but forgiving in many ways.) I've not been in an honors addon, but you usually don't need to do them (I'm a first semester sophomore and I already have more than enough honors credits to complete), although I've heard they're more challenging than other options. You need a certain amount of credits in honors to complete the honors foundation program (this is done before by the end of your sophomore year), however, this isn't too difficult. Even if you don't get through honors, it's not too much extra effort. For that little effort you get to register for your classes before everyone else, and you get cool graduation stuff that looks great on your resume. You also get an honors advisor in your major, and you will be able to live in honors or Lincoln hall your freshman year, they are generally a step above what you can expect for the price in terms of dorms. What I like most about the honors college is the support system it provides, there are many amazing people in the honors college that are here just to help you navigate college. What I've found overall, is that honors students generally know more about campus life, campus resources, and how to be a \"good\" WVU student. If you'd like to know anything else about the Honors College, please let me know, and I can try to help in any way I can.",

By the looks of other replies here, it seems like GPA isn\u2019t a big issue, but obviously if you are able to match what the school wants, it is definitely going to help you get in. If you are on the lower side, I suggest you get a letter of recommendation from one of your university professors if you can to give your application a boost. I know this isn\u2019t in the application- call up WVU and ask them where you can send the letter of recommendation as an additional document alongside your application and they will tell you.

        "body": "Credits:  \nMost of the credits I lost didn't carry over to an 'WVU equivalent'. Like a \"history of Jazz\" music elective I took elsewhere. WVU was just like \"nah\" in matching it up with one of their music electives.  \nThat's just an example.\n\nSome of it was just a weird mis-match type of deal. Like the curriculum I came from had you take 1 economics class of 2 (micro or macro), then take 1 of 2 classes in a different elective group. So I had done all that type of stuff. Then WVU's rule is you have to take **both** economics class, and they didn't care about the other stuff I took.\n\nThey also had weird requirements. The school I came from split physics into 3 classes: 1) Newtonian physics, 2) Gaussian physics, and 3) waves and vibrations.  \nApparently WVU splits their physics curriculum into 2 semesters.  \nI eventually won that fight, but it was kinda weird because my classes actually covered more topics than WVU's 2 classes.\n\nBut I lost more than I won. The first real stupid one was having to **go back** and take English 101.  \nSo, when I first entered community college, my high school SAT scores allowed me to skip over English 101 and 'place into' English 102, which I passed.  \nDespite having the SAT scores to prove it, and taking *literally* the more advanced class (English 102 vs 101) that **requires** the lesser class as a pre-requisite, AND passing English 102, WVU refused to exempt me from the requirement.\n\nSo I had to go back and get English 101 credit...as a junior with like 100 credits. Absolutely ridiculous.\n\nBut here's the worst one, by far:  \nI transferred in with credit for differential equations. MATH242 or something at WVU. Most places (as far as I can tell) have Diff.Eq as a 3 credit class (same with linear algebra and multivariable).  \nApparently, WVU randomly decided to make theirs 4 credits. So they wouldn't honor my diff.eq credit. I tried to appeal it 2 or 3 times. No luck. Dealing with the math department was a pain in the ass.  \nI finally got an ultimatum from them: I can either retake WVU's 4cr diff.eq, OR I can take MATH343 (linear algebra), which actually has diff.eq as a pre-requisite.\n\nIt was insane. They literally held my graduation for the sake of 1 single math credit.\n\nI made a deal with the Engineering department head chair, whatever, thingy, guy. He let me walk in the graduation ceremony, but my graduation would not be official until I satisfied the 1 math credit. I didn't finish it until Summer 2020, so my name is actually listed in 3 graduation ceremonies lol\n\nAs, literally, a **graduating** senior, I had to go back and re-take a **sophomore level** math class (that I already passed), for the sake of a single math credit, when I'd already taken and passed every class that uses diff.eq as a pre-requisite.\n\nThen I had the great misfortune of taking an online summer class (covid, 2020) with an absolutely awful old, foreign professor. Didn't give a crap about the students. Didn't know how to use computers or the web platform at all. Talked to us and sent emails during tests/quizzes. Very obnoxious.  \nI got a 79.5% that he ***WOULDN'T*** round up to a B. I appealed it twice then decided to stop wasting my life on the shitshow that WVU is. The math chair basically just shrugged and said \"the professor has the power to do whatever he wants\", which is the same answer any time I've lodged a complaint about a professor.",

If you want to pay a 150% markup, I'm pretty sure you can get them at the game.\n\nIf you don't mind adding a 30-minute (not including game traffic) round trip detour from Morgantown, Country Club Bakery in Fairmont is one of the original Italian commercial bakeries to make them. If you can get them still warm from the oven, they're really good.\n\nYou can also find their rolls for sale in some convenience stores, but just don't. They need to be fresh because they're on the dry side to begin with and go stale quickly. \n\nFairmont also has Colasessano's Pizzaria, who have their own rolls and offer them split open toasted with all the fixins. The rolls on their own are ok, but they're bready and built for adding peppers sauce and cheese. The Sicilian pizza is pretty good, too.\n\nI second the vote for Home Industry rolls if you stop at Sheetz. The minis are pretty good, but be sure to get at least one full-size for the real experience. For my money, they're the best mass-produced roll in the state. Unfortunately, theyre only open M-F.\n\nRogers and Mazza's are also a quality convenience store option.\n\nIf you want a very convenient, quasi-authentic experience, Apple Annie's in Morgantown offers fresh made rolls, and they're located at the exit you'd probably use to go to the game. They're a PA upstart. They do offer a sauce and cheese option on their menu, which is a good way to go. Though I'm disappointed they don't offer Italian-style peppers instead of the meat sauce.\n\nGrocery stores will also have their own, but they're usually nothing remarkable.\n\nI'm probably missing some good ones, so  keep your eyes on the comments.",

It\u2019s hard to gauge sometimes because you might hear one person brag about their good grade, and 20 other people are silent because they know they just bombed a test. TLDR, you might be struggling, but take solace in the fact that you likely aren\u2019t the only one, and when teachers recognize students are struggling they tend to lighten up.\n\n2) Go to class. It sucks sometime, it might be early or you may have no idea where you are in the content, but just go. Even if you\u2019re so tired and you know you won\u2019t pay attention, go and sleep in the classroom during lecture if you have to. If you\u2019re there, you will pick up on more stuff than you realize (maybe just the prof saying \u201cknow this one simple thing for the exam\u201d in passing).\n\n3) Get your damn HW done. This one is the most important. Everyone hates HW, and because of this almost no one gives HW the time and effort it deserves because you only ever do HW to forget about it. So do. Your. Damn. HW. And not the day before either, do it 3/4/5 days before. I\u2019m baffled by the fact people will stress about a homework for a week after they\u2019ve been putting it off, only to turn in crap work (because you\u2019re not thinking clearly if it\u2019s due in 20 mins and your struggling to finish). Knock it out early, you\u2019ll feel better, you\u2019ll know more, and instead of stressing about it for a week you\u2019ll feel accomplished. Funny enough, I always start my HW with the same \u201cfuck it\u201d mentality as I have when I go to the gym- I just think \u201cfuck this is going to really suck\u2026 well let\u2019s get it over with\u201d\n{ additionally, I\u2019m an aero major and I find when I get my hw done early, people tend to come to you with questions about the HW. Even if you totally BS\u2019d it, having to explain your process is unbelievable for your comprehension of the material. }\n\nRemember why you\u2019re at school. You\u2019re paying a crap ton of money so you can learn from professionals in their field. That\u2019s it. It\u2019s so easy to get caught up in the cOlLeGe LiFe that you lose sight of why tf you\u2019re here.",

        "body": "If you want it to run?  Depends...\n\nSee, the chassis under a PRT vehicle is old. Some of them have well over a half-million miles on them. It's early 1970s stuff. And while it's mostly held up remarkably well, eventually most manufacturers stopped making the weird size tires they take and without the steel belt. \n\nSee, if you have that metal in the tire and you rest that tire against the power rail then there's a chance you could blow the damned thing up and cause it to ignite. So steel-belted radials are out of the question. \n\n\"Uh, not what I asked. Who cares?\"\n\nIt's building toward a point. Stick with me here. A few years back they found a new supplier for PRT tires. Right size, nonmetallic, etc. seemed too good to be true. \n\nAnd with football season, we learned that it WAS too good to be true. Remember in 2017 when the PRT kept going down at the Hospital station after football games?  I do. I was in the control room. \n\nSee, the new tires' sidewalls weren't quite as stiff as the old ones. Put side-by-side, we'd see the new tires deform more in a turn with a lot of weight on board. In particular, that's very bad at Hospital station coming out of channel 1. Power comes from the left at channel 1 there (puts power across the channel from passengers), and stays on the left going into that left-hand turn to come out of the station. The vehicle leans right. With the new tires, it leans even further right. What started happening was, with 20-25 football fans aboard the vehicle it'd just pull right out of the power rail as it started turning left there. There'd be a quick arc, power would cut out, and the bunch of vehicles either in Hospital station's zone or on their way would be in trouble. We'd have to have mechanics push the vehicle manually into the rail again. With pissed off passengers aplenty. Not fun. \n\nSo, to answer the question, I wouldn't put more than 15 AT MOST on a vehicle with those tires on it. If they've found a better solution then disregard. But I doubt they have. \n\nIf you wanna know anything about PRT, feel free to ask. I can tell you, for instance, why 49 and 54 collided between Walnut and Beechurst that one time a few years ago, and why those specific circumstances can no longer occur. Or why I nonetheless trust the old control system more.",

That was several years back, or maybe a decade or more. Before I worked there anyhow. Bombardier provided new motors and Azimuth (I think?) built new computers for the vehicles. The hardware underneath is otherwise still the 70s Boeing retro. \n\nStage 2 was a control system update. Thales basically shitcanned the whole old Boeing system and implemented their train control system. That took effect about 3 years ago, I think?  2018 or 2019. Control room interface changed. Whole operating scheme changed. Now, the vehicles themselves decide where they are and report their positions. I'm honestly not 100% in love with this. \n\nStage 3 was to be brand-new vehicles IIRC, but it's unclear when or even if that'll happen. COVID was hard on PRT, and Gee was a big opponent of it back in the day. Stage 2 cost something like $100,000,000.00. \n\nBut yeah, like I said some of those vehicles already had well over a half-million miles on 'em when I quit over three years ago.",

        "body": "Sorry this took so long. \n\nSo we'd just been in a bad downtime, and right at shift change. I think I came in a little early that day. 1st shift may have been short. When it occurred, it was just me and the 1st and 2nd shift supervisors in the control room. I was on the controls. \n\nNow, unknown to us, one of the vehicles had just barely started moving when it was stopped. It was in Walnut station, channel 2, 1st berth. W2-1. That's where you'd usually board during normal operation. \n\nAll those berths in stations, had 2 PDs. A PD was like a switch that flipped on briefly when a vehicle would pass by. It was physically located out on the guideway. If we knew where each vehicle was at the start of the day and we tracked every PD activation in order, we could tell you where each vehicle was the last time it passed a PD. \n\nStation berths had 2 PDs because you weren't sllowed to have 2 vehicles in adjacent PDs. If vehicle 32 is at PD 15 and vehicle 18 approached from PD 13, it couldn't go past PD 14 until 32 had advanced to PD 16. This was the collision avoidance routine, simplified for discussion. \n\nSo in station, each berth had its PD and another just past it called a \"departure\" PD, before the next berth or non-berth PD. so at W2-1, a vehicle doesn't move far before it gets to W2-1D. But in this very rare instance it did manage to advance out of W2-1 without activating W2-1D yet. What's more, PDs 1 and 2 at least were clear as well. So that vehicle was clear to move, save for whatever system stoppage occurred unrelated to it. And when we looked on the cameras at Walnut, we saw a vehicle seeming in good berth at W2-1. \n\nSo as we started trying to get things running again, we had to so a reset of Walnut and Beechurst station computers. A technician had to manually put some of the info in, and you can't see the guideway from the computer room at Walnut so they depended on us in the control room to tell them. \n\nAlso, the PTZ cam at Walnut only sees W2 channel's first two berths. The computer showed 3 vehicles in W2, and a glance at the cameras didn't disprove it. They're not positioned well for counting vehicles in the back berths. \n\nSo we're needing to do a hardware reset at Walnut. We look at the board. We look at the cameras. We tell the tech at the station to go ahead. Now we send out that vehicle from W2-1 and go on to the dozen other pressing concerns. \n\nProblem:  the vehicle that left W2-1 wasn't the one we thought, but the one that was at W2-2 when things first stopped. The one that was stopped at W2-1 had moved out after we restored power and tried to get things moving.\n\nNow something about resetting the hardware at Walnut with that vehicle out of berth, allowed the vehicle to take off without being tracked by the computer and the next vehicle to advance. So we sent that out thinking it was the previous one. \n\nThat one had stopped at the handover between Walnut and Beechurst. Something to do with that station-to-station handover stopped the unexpected vehicle. \n\nSo when the next one rolled out, the central computer and Walnut station computer were as confused as we were. It rolled right into the back of the stopped vehicle because no one, man or machine, knew it was there. \n\nHere's why this can't happen again. The PDs are gone, and now vehicles track their own positions rather than depend on station computers to do it. If a vehicle stops reporting, the system will create a buffer around its last good position and eventually will stop traffic if it doesn't reestablish contact. Something like that. There's no hardware to resee, no computer to mistakenly instruct where vehicles are/n't. The vehicles have ways of determining their positions and validating their determinations based on fixed points on the guideway. \n\nAgain, the collision resulted from that very slight movement of a vehicle. It had a loaded status and had departed, but hadn't activated the D PD to let anyone know it had started moving. So its default mode when we restarted was to keep moving, but the station computer couldn't track it because we mistakenly told it the vehicle was still berthed. \n\nI feel awful. We only heard about it when one of our mechanics (a volunteer fire/rescue) called on the phone and told us that an ambulance was responding to a collision on the guideway. I understand two people were injured, though one supposedly refused treatment. \n\nFYI, with 3 people in the control room back then it worked like this: one was on vehicle/system control, one was on the electrification power panel, and one was on the cameras and passenger interfaces. We could all 3 see the fixed cameras and the one selected PTZ. We all also could see the power panel (though that display was not reliable) and the mimic board (what showed the positions of activated PDs in the system). There were supervisors in the second and third positions, and an operator (me) in the first. \n\nYou may have heard it was an automated system. That gets a lot more mileage than it deserves. We had to micromanage it for much of the day or it would grind to a halt for a number of reasons.",

        "body": "Not hard at all. Problem is, which vehicle to put you in?  The system didn't decide which vehicle was going where until it actually decided to open the door and let you in. Had an operator done that manually, you might've been let into a vehicle that was going somewhere else. \n\nRemind me, is Arnold downtown?  And you wanted to go to Engineering, from Beechurst?  You'd have had to be on the B platform. If you got up the A platform it only should run to Towers. Good chance if you were on A, someone cleared out your request and figured eventually you'd a) learn to read, b) get bored and leave, or c) pick up the phone and it'd be explained to you. Did that more times in a day than I could count. \n\nYou know, it's pretty crazy how many people couldn't/wouldn't/didn't read a sign, and didn't get the ride they expected because of it. They even spent an extra few million bucks in 2008 or 2009 to buy cool new signs. It was one of the things we had to micromanage constantly when I worked there. And so many people refused to read them. \n\nBut assuming you're not one of them, there are a bunch of different reasons you might've had to wait. No we generally did not let people wait inside when it was cold. As a general rule, below about 20 degrees F outside we'd shorten the wait time a couple minutes from the usual 5:00.\n\nThat early in the morning, it should have been running circulation. Vehicles would have stopped at gates 5 and 6 for all destinations, and stopped at every station. Beechurst and Towers A platforms would be closed (never stopped anyone before, as once again you don't have to be able to read to be a passenger). Engineering A platform was only used in emergencies when I was there. Probably around 8:15 or so the day shift would put the system in demand mode, and then it was like this:\n\nTowers A went only to Beechurst. \n\nBeechurst A went only to Towers. \n\nEngineering B went everywhere. \n\nTowers B went everywhere except Beechurst. \n\nBeechurst B went everywhere except Towers. \n\nWalnut and Hospital went everywhere from their single platforms. \n\nNow, the old system wouldn't let us exclude a particular destination from a particular platform, so here's where we had to micromanage the rushes at Towers and Beechurst. Every so often we'd just cancel ALL requests at the busy station and manually dispatch vehicles. So say there was a rush at Beechurst for Towers. Assuming I had vehicles to cover it, about every minute or so I'd sent B1 to T, B3 to E, B6 to H, and B5 to W, and clear the requests. B4 was almost never used for passenger service, and B2 was only used really when BEE A was swamped. \n\nNow in that scenario, if you were waiting for Towers on Beechurst B platform, or waiting for anywhere except Towers on Beechurst A platform, then you were shit outta luck. You might get lucky and sneak one past us, but if we caught it we'd halt it or reroute it. Again, BIG BRIGHT FUCKING SIGNS. Can't miss 'em. \n\nAdmittedly that's kinda shitty when things are slow. But again, there are ways to figure it out. There's a phone on every single passenger platform. Use your words. \n\nI wanna take a break to mention that the shittiest passengers BY AFUCKING MILE were not students, but a) local crackheads trying to score drugs at Ruby and b) drunk 50-something (or older) sports fans. I'm not shitting on students. Morgantown wants to blame \"the students\" for all its problems, but that's honestly just not it. \n\nBut we are/were royal assholes nonetheless. (Class of 2012 here)\n\nAnyway. Yeah, if you waited more than 5:00 then one of a few things most likely happened:\n\n- You were on the wrong platform\n- You missed your ride\n- Central canceled it for some reason, and never covered your request\n- There was a service disruption. \n\nTo that last point, the number two reason for service disruptions when I worked there was \"passenger induced\" by just pure number of incidents. Pax induced did tend to be shortest, to be fair.",

You'll see him downtown with his belongings on a dolly or a rolling suitcase. Older white man. Pretty terse, gruff voice. He insists on paying for his ride, even when we let him come up on the elevator so he doesn't have to lug all his stuff up the stairs. He rides once a day usually, and usually from Walnut to Hospital and back. He'll get off at Hospital, go out, come back in, PAY AGAIN, etc. Never holds doors. Never tries to screw with the turnstiles. (I've personally watched both Gee and Solomon do these things.) Model passenger. In winter I think the folks at Bartlett House give him extra quarters so he can ride more and stay warm when it's really cold but they're not open yet. \n\n2) PRT platform camera footage can be used as evidence in court. Local police regularly ask if they have footage of certain things near PRT platforms. Didn't have to be ON WVU property. One of the engineers there would copy the requested footage to disc for them usually next day when they asked. \n\n3) (Knock on wood.)

Back in the day when someone couldn\u2019t get a ticket, we\u2019d take a good ticket, put it into photoshop and change the name. Now you have two tickets with the same barcode. Obviously if it gets scanned, the fake one won\u2019t be good. But there is like a 8-12 second delay. So what you do is stand in two separate line and have the guy with the good ticket get scanned first (since it would suck if he/she didn\u2019t get in because they let you copy a ticket) then the second person would get scanned second. If you time it out right, the scanners hasn\u2019t registered the first ticket and you both get in. \n\nThat was back in my day, I don\u2019t know if they do phone tickets or whatever now but when we had printed tickets this worked. I was pretty much a campus treasure. I would be called to frat houses the day of them game. Do a dozen of these, then party with them because I was the savior.

But if you want to get to know people anyway, living in a res hall probably wouldn\u2019t be a bad idea - you\u2019d start off the fall semester just as new to the school as everyone else (unlike living in an apartment with upper classmen, who might already have social groups).

You can transmit viruses whether you\u2019re infected or not, and on the other side you can have viruses transmitted to you and not be infected. It\u2019s pretty clear you\u2019re not arguing with unvaccinated people and calling them names out of the goodness of your heart and you want them to be safe, so I would love to know why you actually want to cram vaccination down people\u2019s throats. No matter how you slice it, if you\u2019re vaccinated and protected then whether or not someone else is vaccinated or not is irrelevant because there is no data to suggest it reduces transmission, but there is data to suggest it reduces infection. Meaning that vaccination should be a personal choice, and should you want to risk getting the vaccine or risk not getting it is no one\u2019s business but yours and your doctor\u2019s.",

It all began with him. \n\n> **Can you talk a little bit about WVU\u2019s deep engagement in the Middle East and your relationship with the Royal University for Women (RUW) in Bahrain?**\n\n> We\u2019ve always had a large contingent of students from the Middle East, because of the fact that we have one of the premier petroleum engineering programs in the country. A large number of the leadership in Saudi Aramco [the Saudi national oil and gas company] are West Virginia University graduates. So there was that natural tie; we had a presence there, we had educated a number of people [from the region], and we have a strong contingent of West Virginia graduates in the Middle East.\n\n> The Royal University for Women is a unique institution through which we can build a global portal. I\u2019m a very strong believer that when institutions build campuses overseas, in many ways that\u2019s cultural imperialism. I think that there has been more failure than success in that regard. When I came [back to WVU] I said, \u201cWhere are areas in which we can be uniquely positioned to have an outside role in either that part of the world or in a relationship with likeminded institutions?\u201d That could be something in which we can really make progress and [collaborate on] programs together.\n\n> I\u2019m actually on the board of RUW, so that shows how deeply committed the university is. It happened to be through the Al-Zamil family, of which three of the brothers [studied] here during my first tenure. We became very fast friends. They had a large number of daughters, and they decided that they wanted to build a university that was royally chartered, the only one of its kind in the Middle East, to really focus on the empowerment of young women. [It was] a great opportunity for our university.\n\n\n[Source](https://www.nafsa.org/ie-magazine/2019/11/1/e-gordon-gee-embracing-internationalization)",

Another big issue is money, ODU is also very expensive and they do not really give scholarships freely and WVU based on their website and scholarships, I can get some money which would be helpful. I honestly think a school i would best into is JMU. but if that does not work out WVU might have to do. So money wise, my option will probably be WVU, just sorta scared I won\u2019t find a group of people i would fit in with at WVU.",

Morgantown is a lot like most of the rustbelt college towns out there, and whether or not that's what you're looking for determines a lot of what you'd get out of attending. At the very least I recommend touring at least 2 or 3 campuses, preferably including at least one that's unlike the others.\n\nIt was okay, but I think about how different it would have been sometimes.",

We can't cure cancers that have been around for 100 years, but we can figure out a unknown virus in 8 months, give me a break. People really can't wait to shoot unknown shit into their arms, all you gotta do is offer them a Xbox or free tuition or a doughnut. Give me 5 years to see what happens, and maybe I'll get it then. I have all my other vaccines, only skipped the HPV and covid. I don't want something that was rushed, no matter who approves it. The more they push it, the more it makes us not want to get it. Plus, if something goes wrong, you can't even hold Pfizer or J&J accountable. They literally lobbied and got the law changed so they're not responsible if you sustain injury. The whole messaging and rollout of this stuff has made me incredibly leery of it all. Seems like they change their mind every day as to what's going on. If your vaccine works so good, why are you worried about what I do. Evidently, they don't fucking work if you can still get sick and spread it.",

Kids can't get vaccinated, so it's a threat to them.

There are some serious disorders that people have that don't let them get vaccinated. Us being vaccinated AND wearing masks helps protect these individuals.\n\nSome reports are showing that vaccinated people CAN still spread the virus but be symptomless to the virus itself. This is up in the air as there are many different reports, but waiting for further evidence is smarter.\n\nMost importantly, I think, is that the people refusing to get vaccinated pose a threat to those who are because each time the virus enters a new body, it mutates. If it mutates enough, it may produce a strain that will make the vaccine no longer effective. That would affect everyone.\n\nMasks are super annoying, and I'm just as angry at the willfully unvaccinated, but practical concerns make this policy a smart one for the university.",

The covid module is a joke. You literally click next the entire way though, you don't even answer the questions and it gives you the 100. Them coming out and giving those as the reason and making the unvaccinated people look terrible is just the university throwing a hissy fit that their pr stunt didn't work out. They shot themselves in the foot, now those that aren't vaccinated definitely aren't going to. I've head several people from both camps say \"what even was/is the point in getting vaccinated\". Nobody is going to do it now, and nobody is getting the booster either. What's the point if the university throws out \"MASK UP MASK UP NEXT 30 DAYS ONLINE\" even without evidence there is any substantial spread between students. I watched the campus conversation and the amount of people that wanted masks and mandatory vaccine was honestly sad. There are some people out there that don't want this to end and won't be happy until 0 covid. It's madness.",

I learned something along time ago when I was in the military, if you get a gut feeling about something pay attention to it & use your instincts, I'm glad I did because it's kept me all these years and I'm listening to my gut & I'm using my instincts now and I'm not going to change.",

The way it is set up there is not supposed to be more than a 15-minute wait (at least while everything is actually up and running). I was off-campus and mostly took the PRT to/from Walnut; Beechurst to Towers is much more frequented and will have more cars dedicated to that route. I'd recommend giving yourself at least a half-hour so you don't have to run on either side of it. I only had maybe four instances where I had a wait time of 30 minutes or more over 6 years and my professors were always understanding.",

It's more important not to have big student loan debt, because jobs in IT are abundant.\n\nIn those days we learnt PL/I supposedly because we could use either COBOL or FORTRAN, the two most popular languages among companies hiring WVU CS grads at the time. Electrical engineering students were learning C which turned out to be a better option in the long term. But I don't think it was easy to predict that future. \n\nI learned the basics and most of the professors were decent, a few were excellent. Word of mouth will let you know which ones to avoid. You're going to have to keep learning on your own in computer science, because the field is evolving. \n\nAlso, as far as expectations from professors go, don't forget that at any university most tenure-track professors get promoted because of their research work, and teaching undergrad students is sadly a huge distraction to that. They don't explain this at orientation. Knowing this doesn't make it suck less when you find an instructor lackluster, but helps explain their lack of motivation. They're there mostly to do research and train grad students, and undergrads are secondary.",

Some of the people I worked with were weak programmers, didn't know what binary trees are, never used Linux, etc. \n\nWVU CS I think does a good job making sure people know their shit and are going to be workforce ready.",

While it might depend on your RAs whether or not the frogs get reported if you bring them against the rules, they have absolutely 0 influence on housing policy. Even the residence hall coordinators can't do anything about that. \n\nReptiles and amphibians can be certified as ESA but only one ESA is allowed. Unless you can talk to upper housing administration and convince them to make an exception, there's not a way within the rules to bring them and live in a dorm.\n\nAll this being said, there's nothing stopping you from bringing them and doing your best to keep them hidden. If you have a roommate I'd make sure they're on board. The only time anyone from housing will be in your room will be pre-break safety checks, so as long as you bring the frogs home with you and keep them out of line of sight from the door, you should be good. If they do get discovered, you'll be given a slap on the wrist and given a few days to get them out of the building. Best of luck, hopefully you find a solution that works for you!",
