I\u2019m sure it\u2019s the same at rice, but profs here are super intentional/involved, which is great, but not so great if you like to slack off. So be aware of that. If you\u2019re needing to take physics or cs classes for requirements, take them at MCC. You\u2019re gpa will thank you big time. If you need to take calc courses, MCC is also great, but there\u2019s definitely a couple of gems in the math department. Also some really horrible options too, so tread lightly. Finding friends: your best bet is to plug into a church since Baylor is a very religious campus. But if you\u2019re not a Christian, I\u2019d say try getting into the intramural sports or greek life. Drop date for classes is earlier than most schools too I believe. There\u2019s also a foreign language requiring which requires you to take three or four semester hours of the same language. I feel like the culture here is very cliquey or \u201cboxy.\u201d So like people will stereotype you as a nerd or a sorority girl and it\u2019s not often that you see intermixing in these groups. But as long as you know love you are and put yourself out there you\u2019ll definitely find excellent friendships, even coming in as a transfer student. Also, party culture here is pretty different since it\u2019s a Christian campus. It\u2019s available, but there\u2019s way less available than at other campuses and it\u2019s not too difficult to develop a \u201ctrashy\u201d reputation here if you aren\u2019t careful. Also, Baylor is a dry campus and I know several people who\u2019ve gotten in trouble with the school after being caught with alcohol or drunk while on campus. Avoid the chick fil a on campus\u2026the lines are always WAY too long and you\u2019re better off driving to the one off campus. Watch out being alone in Waco at night, it\u2019s pretty sketchy. Even just going to grab take out. Be prepared for a million random road closures around campus because there\u2019s been a lot of construction and it\u2019s been a super chaotic and disorganized process, and the construction workers loooove just randomly shutting down roads on any given random day. Also, lots of businesses are closed on sundays. That\u2019s all I can think of right now",

        "body": "Hiya,\n\n\\- Some background: I am a Ph.D. student in a stem (physiology) field at Baylor (have my M.S. in Physiology and B.S. in Exercise Physiology/Biology.\n\nThis is a throwaway account, however, I can provide some insight into what it is like to be a science student at many universities and what I have found over the years.\n\nFirst, I think it is a common misconception that they intentionally make the courses hard in the first-year courses (weed-out courses). Instead, I think it is best to think of them as an introduction to the rigor that science requires. The reason why STEM is so different than other majors is the mobility of conceptualization it requires, rather than the amount that you can memorize (this is still important, just not the foundation). Anyone is welcome to disagree with me on my synopsis of STEM, however, I have found that while I work with my students, or instruct those who are not familiar with the studying habits, ways to move through content, or overall \\*intensity, e.g. requirements\\* of certain courses -their hardships are mostly due to their studying habits. You won't love every class, I know I didn't, but the ability to overcome those things that you perceive as difficult and build your knowledge base as you move through STEM is something that only ever help you in life.\n\nStudying science can definitely be challenging in many ways, but with the right approach, you can learn and understand any complex concept and have it be extremely rewarding.\n\nHere are the tips that I share with all of my undergraduate and master's students:\n\n**Understand the basics**: Science builds on fundamental principles, so it's important to have a solid foundation. Make sure you understand basic concepts and terminology before moving on to more advanced topics.\n\n**Read actively**: Don't just passively read your textbook or notes. Highlight or underline important information, ask questions, and take notes as you go. This will help you stay engaged and retain more information.\n\n**Practice problem-solving: Science often involves solving problems and applying concepts to real-world situations. While working through your notes, make sure you ask yourself, \"What kind of question can come from this work/slide, what about this is important, and why did they put it on the slide?\"**\n\n**Use visual aids:** Science often involves complex diagrams, charts, and graphs. However, these are to your advantage as a graph/picture can say 1000 words.\n\n**Collaborate with others**: Studying with others can be helpful, as you can bounce ideas off each other and learn from different perspectives and make sure you review regularly to reinforce what you are learning. Also, try to teach others. This will highlight what you do and do not have a grasp of. If you feel like you are avoiding a certain topic, that is where you should start!\n\nRemember, studying science takes time and effort, but all professors and students want you to succeed!",

        "body": "my understanding is it\u2019s a sub program under the honors college (like u schol or great texts) that you can participate in to provide extra opportunities like dinners and seminars (like the regular honors program) focused mainly on religion and philosophy rather than the broader or more random ones the regular honors program does. not certain if crane does but a lot of programs like these also open you up to apply for special scholarships that students outside of the program aren\u2019t allowed to. i haven\u2019t seen or heard anything relating to special crane scholarships but i wouldn\u2019t be surprised if this one does like other selective programs. \n\nbecause it\u2019s under the honors program you would have to apply and be accepted into the honors program first (highly recommend it based on my experience, also gives you an extra option for housing that isn\u2019t super difficult to get a room in because it\u2019s only honors students and you aren\u2019t fighting for a room with the other thousands of freshman who don\u2019t have the honors dorm option) so this is the same process as with u schol as it requires you to get into the honors college first then you can be selected for the u schol program. \n\n\nhonors in general has requirements you have to meet every year to stay in the program (so any sub program will require them so you remain eligible since they\u2019re part of the honors program):\n\nfreshman year- fall semester honors seminar class (i did trends in healthcare with dr. neilson and it was and still is my favorite out of all the classes i\u2019ve taken but it should be related to your major but it doesn\u2019t necessarily have to be it would just get you the most bang for your buck since it would count towards your major) then in the spring you start a two semester series of great texts classes. \n\nthroughout your four years- you have to take a colloquium normally spring sophomore or sometime junior year. you also have to keep a minimum 3.5 gpa and take at least one honors designated course every semester. (the seminar, great texts, and colloquium all count as your required honors course for those semesters.) there is an option for an exception for a semester if you either don\u2019t have an honors option that falls within your major or you have to take a hell semester that\u2019s super heavy and difficult but it isn\u2019t super common for most people to have to request an exception. \n\nsenior year- you do an honors senior thesis with a faculty mentor which is usually a fat research paper but some people do lab research or a business plan depending on their major. after it\u2019s finished you have to defend it to a panel but it\u2019s chill for a most people because your mentor will make sure your project is complete before they let you defend it. (i did lab research because i was an environmental health major and my sister\u2019s fianc\u00e9 was u schol doing computer science and philosophy so he did a fat research paper)\n\nthe sub programs may have certain extra requirements on top of the general honors ones but i only did the regular honors so i\u2019m not familiar with them. you should talk to your advisor (if you already have your advisor assignment or you can talk to your admissions counselor that you\u2019ve had through your baylor application process) to get more information on everything. \n\ni\u2019m not sure when the deadline is/ was to apply for honors if you\u2019re starting in august but if it\u2019s too late you can still apply sometime before the start of your junior year or if you have about 4 semesters left when you would start the program so you have time to complete the requirements. \n\nif you\u2019re interested in the honors dorm keep in mind that it\u2019s a two year contract rather than just one like most other dorms so you\u2019d have to stay there for freshman and sophomore year. after sophomore year you can of course stay in the honors dorm however many semesters after that or you can live off campus.",

What a crazy time that was!\n\n If you can avoid that, have your summer needs met, and have the luxury of focusing your time and energy on that class alone - it may be worth your while to try it out.

A little box that says \"more options\" should pop up. Click the little drop down arrow and select \"cached\". It'll bring up a cached version of the page from the last time you visited the website (even if you've never visited that specific professor's page before). It's great in a pinch, but keep in mind that a review uploaded after the date you last accessed bubooks would not show up. Hope this helps :))",

I think the next closest are Georgia Tech, UCLA or Ohio State.\n\nAs for value, some people do pay less for a quality education. In Texas, UT and A&M are both good values.

That is kinda the nature of the software engineering internship process. Look it up but that is your best way to land major internship offers.\n\nWith that said I think cost should be your biggest motivator. 5-10k is significantly better than 20k and I believe you'll thank yourself when you get older. If you can get Baylor to 10K then personally I would like Baylor more due to the culture but at that point its more personal preference. \n\nOne thing I can add is when you reach out to Baylor mention and show them your offer letter from UC Merced and say you would prefer Baylor but that the cost makes it hard for you. In my case this helped my get a higher offer letter from Baylor.",

I got into a pseudo-Ivy League school but opted instead to go to a much more affordable university in my state because I had nearly a full ride. Initially, as an 18 or 19 year old, I regretted not going to the big-name school (because I didn't know any better; the prestige sounded \"cool\"), but where I am now in life, I'm so glad I didn't put myself or my parents into enormous debt from attending that school. Education is education; great professors can be found at any university.\n\nAny school can be amazing if you're in a major you love and try to connect with your professors and campus-life. And not putting yourself into crippling debt makes your mid to late 20s so much easier. I promise you can get a good job no matter which school you choose here. Your experience and skills are really more important in job interviews than the school listed on your resume/CV.\n\nEdit: Also for what it's worth, I've noticed some of the CS faculty at Baylor are hard to work with and not overly friendly to students if you're not interested in the exact area of research they are. Biggest example is Dr. Pablo Rivas. But I've heard great things about Dr. Greg Hamerly, Dr. Greg Speegle, and Dr. Jeff Donahoo, though that doesn't mean their courses are easy, just that they're nice people and willing to help you.",

You might be able to get a little more merit aid but no way you are going to close a 55k gap. Also the merit aid is contingent upon maintaining very high grades. I have heard 3.7-3.8. You can drop below that by getting a B or two the first year and then you are left with no aid at all. Nearly all the need based aid that US students are Pell Grants and guaranteed student loans for the government and you are not eligible for that. A lot of US students can\u2019t come up with the money either because they fall short even maxing out loans. Baylor is very expensive and does not give out much aid. You need to look at schools that are less competitive and try to get 100 percent merit aid",

I am a current junior here so it was a bit different for me two years ago during covid. I think Baylor has gotten competitive this past year as they admitted a lot of students the other classes. About 45% got in for fall 2022 so moderately competitive. \n\nMaybe you can send in a letter of continued interest and see if the Adcom change your enrollment to fall semester.",

All the credits for the classes taken with Verto transfer to Baylor or to the 70 other Universities in the program in the US.    You can still graduate in 4 years.  It\u2019s probably less expensive than going to Baylor which full pay tuition with room and board is $68k.  Tuition and room and meals for the Costa Rica location is $19.5 a semester. Seville Spain is the $19.5 as well for tuition room and meals   All the other locations dont include meals or just some meals but they have kitchens.  Buenos Aires $19.5K, Prague $19.5k, Florence $23k and London is $29k.   It takes Fafsa and has scholarships, you can use 529 money  as well.  Im considering it for my daughter.   The classes are small at Verto, like 30 kids,  and she would get  credits for the undergrad classes she has to take that would otherwise  have 100\u2019s of kids in them given in auditoriums at University of Colorado, Boulder where she is accepted and is probably attending in the fall.  But I dont think she would do as well in the huge undergrad classes there.  Its fine when you get to the  upper level classes, they are much smaller of course.  Her classes at her school now have 10 kids max in them. It\u2019s kind of like a gap year but you still get useable credits.   She also likes to travel who doesnt.",

However, instead of just denying them, Baylor is offering a 'prove yourself' challenge for students that *really* want to come to Baylor. So if Student X really loves Baylor and wants to attend, they'll do a study abroad experience and then start school in the spring. In theory, they build friendships with all the other people doing the same program, so they don't show up in the spring completely alone.\n\nIt's not a scam, exactly, but it's hard to say it's a good value. Students in these programs get little to no scholarships from the school and miss out on college experiences, too. It's really  for students that only see themselves attending a specific school.",

Baylor is going to struggle now that NIL is a thing, so if a winning football team is important, UT is probably a better option.\n\n\nSize, I much prefer the campus size of Baylor to UT.   Baylor is big enough to have enough diversity and loads of people, small enough to find your group, and run into them again, class sizes are smaller and you have not interaction on campus with staff and professors. UT, you could easily run into someone and never see them again.\n\n\nGreek, if you want to join a fraternity or sorority, it's going to be easier and less expensive at Baylor. Greek life st Baylor is going to be kind of watered down, compared to a huge school like UT, so I don't know what is better. \n\n\nOpportunity / Network, UT is likely going to provide more opportunity for connections and success post graduation. Just the sheer volume of alumni alone helps with that. And, better chance you rub elbows with someone in undergrad at UT that will turn out to be some head honcho. \n\n\nI think as a naive high school kid, I wanted to go to UT, because it seemed 'cool', but in the end, I found my place at Baylor and likely would have not have enjoyed the same at UT.",

However, having one from Texas will likely lead to a few more opportunities simply because of the sheer size of the Texas alumni population. The networking opportunities that a Texas degree offers are nothing to sneeze at. This is particularly true if you want to work in the state of Texas or in certain major metro areas outside of Texas (NYC, Los Angeles, the Bay Area). That said, if you go to Baylor and do lots of internships, that can close the gap.\n\nAlso, if you plan on pursuing an MBA after your bachelor's, the McCombs School of Business at Texas is considered one of the best business schools in the nation while the Hankamer School of Business at Baylor is more in the \"solid-to-good\" category.",

I was in a similar position in high school, despite scholarships I definitely had some guilt for the financial strain that college would put on my family. However, I channeled that guilt and used it as motivation to graduate early, which helped lower overall cost of attendance. My parents were happy to see me thrive, but I understood that the impetus was on me to make the most of my undergrad experience. \n\nKeep applying to those church-affiliated scholarships: lots of them go unfilled each year. Consider transferring in from a community college. \n\nI don't know if any admin lurk on this subreddit but the decision to move away from merit/need based scholarships is so ridiculous and disingenuous to Baylor's proposed plans to grow the value and inclusivity of the student body. Baylor is one of the two private universities in the US to have GROWN their endowment through the COVID, yet so many great would-be matriculants are still priced out. Clearly our balance sheet isn't the problem, why are we still selecting based on financial means?",

I know Baylor tell you that tuition is 75k but that included non-billable costs. Tuition is 54,844 and add dorm (4-5k) and a meal plan. I know it is still high but the the 31k grant you got will apply to your billable only. You can always go to the One Stop office and they will tell you exactly how much you will end up paying without the added non-billable, It almost always ends up being less than what Baylor says on the financial aid offer. \nAnd if that\u2019s still too much money then I recommend going to maybe Collin College for a year or so and then transferring to baylor as a sophomore or junior because you will qualify for a lot more scholarships.",

That means UNT is probably going to be significantly cheaper, although I don't know what your financial aid situation is there. If you haven't already, try to visit both campuses (ideally during the week when students are around) to try and get a sense of the community at both. Denton and Waco aren't terribly dissimilar, although Denton's proximity to DFW might mean a different college experience than what you would get in Waco.\n\nBased on what you've said here, I would advise you to really consider UNT because I always recommend trying to graduate with the least amount of debt possible.",

If you are not an extrovert, I\u2019d highly recommend it as showing up day one knowing a few familiar faces that have a shared experience to you is helpful to not feel isolated.\n\nIf you choose not to go, Baylor still has other optional activities for incoming classes to attend upon arrival to the dorms, where you are doing the same summer camp activities led by faculty and CL\u2019s that encourage meeting new people.

A lot of the people my first semester tended to stick to those they already knew or the people they met in line camp because they were familiar. They have welcome week where they encourage people to attend the events to meet new people but I saw that a lot of the people either didn\u2019t attend or seemed uninterested if they did go. I did the one day orientation and was able to meet some people but it didn\u2019t seem to last since we were only able to talk and hang out for about an hour and even then a lot of the people that went to orientation went with people from their hometown or something like that.

        "body": "This team was deeply flawed as nobody in the rotation was really a true two-way player, especially our guards.  We made the call to sacrifice defense for offense in that case, which works against inferior teams or when you play at home.  However, you saw time and time again that when the offensive faucet ran dry, we were incapable of stopping te game from getting away from us.  Virginia/Marquette games in the fall & KU/KSU/ISU games in the spring were massive red flags.  Luckily, the team has a strong chance to be better next year with JTT fully healthy, Love developing, Cryer/Bridges back, and two athletic/lengthy freshman in Walker & Little coming in.  Just add some solid transfers at wing and we should contend in the big 12.",

I had a great time at Baylor and actually graduated debt free due to financial aid and scholarships, but I have friends still paying off tens (if not hundreds) of thousands in loans. I also make good money and am in a good place in my career, but I attribute none of that to Baylor or my undergrad degree. I\u2019m also saying this as someone who came from lower middle class and really couldn\u2019t afford Baylor. For those with \u201cdaddy\u2019s money,\u201d I suppose it doesn\u2019t matter the cost. But assuming you\u2019re financially responsible for your education, then no. \n\nThe Baylor name, especially outside of Texas, does little to boost you compared to many other cheaper and better schools. If you can get in, UT has an exceptional global reputation and equal or better quality of academics in almost any department. If you\u2019re from out of state, you may have top academic institutions in your state as well that will have a stronger and better network. The network is why the name of a school matters, and Baylor\u2019s just isn\u2019t THAT big. \n\nIf you just want the Baylor experience (small community, nice people, Christian school, etc) then sure, it\u2019s worth it.

Engineering at Blinn (TEAB) was made as more of a spillover program for admitting students who would have gotten a full-time admission to the main campus, but by the time they came to their app, they just ran out of space. You get all the benefits a full-time TAMU student does; you live on campus, join orgs, can join honors, attend the same engineering courses, etc. You just take your core courses (math and science) at Blinn. But this really isn't even bad, as you save 2K per semester on average. TAMU does this thing called ETAM, where you need a certain GPA to get guaranteed admission to your first-choice major, and all engineering students, regardless if they are full-time TAMU or not, must go through this. So it is a level playing field for everybody, Blinn or not. Hope this helps (ik it's a lot).",

College classes are a huge transition. \n\nI'd urge you genuinely evaluate how you're spending your time. If you're responsibly studying and are still not seeing results, you **must change the way you are studying**. Baylor's STEM curriculum is transitioning towards a more active-learning, applications based approach to teaching. You are expected to have mastery of the learning objectives (which is what homework is for), and apply your knowledge (which is what exams test for). \n\nLectures are more of a springboard to **introduce** concepts, and it is up to the you to encode this. Lecture notes are the bare minimum and, so I've always urged students to use textbook material to fill in the gaps. Videos work better for some people. (Bozeman, O Chem Tutor). \n\nTBH don't get worked up about \"clicking\" with Dr. Klausmeyer. That's just his personality and your relationship with your science profs will have little to no bearing on your final grade. How do you usually feel after you complete an exam? Confident, or \"wow there were lots of questions I didn't know how to do?\"",

Baylor requires participation in various classes/events because interdisciplinary education/exposure develops well-rounded undergrads. \n\nChapel is a longtime Baylor tradition, and functions to allow for students to explore (mainly Christian) spirituality and develop interpersonal bonds with peers. Sometimes there are guest speakers, and the hardest part about the class is showing up and staying awake. I believe Baylor now offers online sections, and two semesters are required. \n\nLifetime fitness is a one semester requirement. Baylor offers a wide expanse of classes from beginner bowling to advanced rock climbing with a focus on self-improvement as well as how exercise is beneficial to mind and body. Take the infamous \"rest and relaxation\" if you want to cheese the class, or challenge yourself with the bowling courses which I have always heard great things about. \n\nCreative Arts Experiences are exactly as they sound. Everybody has to attend two events from each of the following categories: Art, Film, Music, Theatre, and Literature/World Cultures. In-person/online offerings are offered year round, but people put these off and get in trouble with Baylor registry because the requirement is a stringent one. The events themselves are hit-or-miss, but some of them are actually really cool. Off the top of my head: watching *Parasite* inside a packed classroom, learning a traditional Native American war dance, getting a guided tour in an art museum about the psychology of advertising. \n\nChristian Scriptures and Heritage are also 3 hour, semester-long courses that may be a requirement. These are cool classes if you are open to participation and contemplation, regardless of your religious affiliation. A constant theme of Baylor's curriculum is that although the fundamental mission is Christian-led, the real aim is to give students exposure to other cultures, religions, attitudes, social demographics, etc. It is up to you to decide if these experiences re-affirm your spirituality, or the opposite.",

        "body": "I was in this position and TBH never found my crowd and didn't really pick up any good friends during college.\n\nSome of that was my fault and bad luck. I ended up in a dorm that just wasn't a good fit for me as more of an introvert (Penland) and didn't make any friends through that. \n\nI was trying to get admitted as a transfer to a reach school that had rejected me when I applied in 12th grade and was mostly focused on that. I didn't get into that school, the backup I also applied to didn't seem like a good fit either, and I ended up coming back to Baylor as a sophomore because all the other transfer deadlines had passed and it was either that or going to the commuter university in my hometown. \n\nA lot of people seem to make friends through church but I always considered my spirituality more of a private matter and preferred to sleep in on Sunday mornings. I basically kept to myself most of sophomore year and felt like I was in this vicious cycle where I didn't want to try to be involved in an organization where I didn't know anyone but I didn't know anyone because I wasn't involved in anything. \n\nEventually I bit the bullet, not wanting to feel like my whole college experience was a waste, and forced myself to go find a couple of organizations to be a part of as a junior/senior. While I liked the people in them, they all knew each other better from having already been together and I didn't really hang out with them much outside official meetings/events.\n\nBut the good news for you is that because all of that stuff already happened to *me*, you can avoid it by using it as a learning experience. My recommendations:\n\n1. If you live off campus, spend as much time on campus as possible. Don't do what I did and mostly just hang out alone in my apartment when I wasn't in class.\n\n2. Treat this like a job search - go to as many different organization meetings/events as you can. If it interests you and clicks, congratulations. If it doesn't, move on to the next thing. Be aware that some are more open to people getting involved mid-semester than others (either because they have to collect dues and reserve facilities/equipment based on the number of people, or its something like Greek life where they only do recruitment at the beginning of each semester). If that means making a calendar of events and giving yourself little \"rewards\" for meeting your goals, do that. \n\n3. If you're more religiously inclined, find a church that works for you and get involved with their college ministry. You'll typically wind up in a small group or \"lifegroup\" that meets regularly for Bible studies and other gettogethers.\n\n4. If you're still at a loss, try joining organizations that directly relate to your major. \n\n5. If you can afford to and it works with your schedule, try to find a study abroad opportunity this summer. \n\n6. Once you've found something that fits, just throw yourself into it headfirst. Be at every meeting. Show up early and talk to people who are already there; don't just bolt for the door the second official business has ended. The next time they do leadership elections, run for something. They probably already did that for this semester but you can still proactively reach out to the group leaders and offer to help them with their responsibilities. You could even offer to do a small project yourself - organize a fundraiser or a philanthropy project or just some kind of group outing. See one of those people in one of your classes? Sit by them. Ask if they want to study for a test together.",

        "body": "Hey friend, I'm going to give you the hard advice I wish I had listened to when I was in a similar position.\n\nOver four years, I took about 50k in debt, half in public and half in private loans. After Baylor, I became a public school teacher, then grad school, then the pandemic meant I didn't need to pay off my public loans. So based on 25k in private loans alone, my monthly student loan payment is just under $500. And if I only paid that, my principal would only increase, meaning I would end up owing more than I took out despite making payments.\n\nLet's imagine that through scholarships, parental contributions, and public loans, you're able to reduce your private loan total to just 25k per year. After graduating, you would likely owe close to *$2000 per month*. Even if you graduated with a great job, after rent, you would probably have less than a thousand dollars to pay for a car (easily $300 a month), food (easily $300 a month), and any sort of social life you'd like to have. And that's assuming your job provides full health insurance for free--a rarer and rarer benefit. Fingers crossed no politician is dumb enough to turn on public loan payments again! (They are.)\n\nTL;DR: The degree you get from any institution is probably not going to be worth the excruciating weight of this amount of debt. Unless you're getting substantially more scholarships, somewhere cheaper would probably be a better idea in the long term.\n\nI hope you're able to find the resources you need to make all your dreams come true. I was very lucky and worked really hard to get as many scholarships as I could, but they still weren't really enough to justify the debt I'm only now in a position to really aggressively pay off my debt, and that's really more because of my partner's (debt free because of socialism) degree.",

But unlike bigger schools or TCU or SMU, it's not totally overwhelming/pervasive for those outside of it, especially if you're not in the business school.\n\nI will say, however, that sorority life is significantly bigger at Baylor than frat life. I think close to half (if not an outright majority) of women I knew at Baylor were Greek, whereas I would probably go weeks at a time without speaking with a frat boy outside of intramural sports opponents. From what I can gather, trying to socialize as a non-Greek girl at Baylor seems much more difficult than as a non-Greek guy.\n\nNote that my experience is heavily colored by the fact that, as a BINF major, I spent half my time in biology/pre-med circles (which are like 80% female) and the other half in computer science circles (in which virtually nobody of either gender is Greek). Sororities seem much friendlier to difficult academic majors than fraternities do, no small part of which is probably the extensive hazing freshman year that frats do which will almost certainly sink your grades if you're in hard classes. I've heard they've cracked down on that sort of thing quite a bit since my time, but most of what I heard of wasn't exactly legal in the first place so who knows what the landscape is like now.\n\nBut once again, experiences may vary if you run in different circles, which is honestly kind of the beauty of college. You can shape your social life however you want it to be by choosing where you hang out and what activities you get involved in.",

At my undergrad I had classes I showed up to 3 times all semester (syllabus week, midterm, and final), you will never find that at Baylor, for better or worse.\n\nIf you are someone who is motivated and will seek out all of the academic resources Baylor provides then you will get more bang for your buck than you will at state schools. If you are someone who's not going to take advantage of office hours/SI/Tutoring/advising/etc. and the only social club you plan on joining is greek life, then you're better off going to state school for cheaper.",

I pulled the costs from the websites and Baylor is 52 tuition + 14 room/board = 66K/year.  UT is 14 tuition + 13 room/board = 27K/year.  So that would mean scholarships of around 40K per year to get the cost about the same?  Would that level of scholarship be only for very elite level students which are only given to a few?  Or is that level pretty common?  On another reddit post I was seeing what looked like pretty strong students with high GPAs, test scores, AP, etc getting 16 to 19K per year.  Which would mean with aid Baylor would be about 21 to 24K per year more?  Sound about right?",

The program is small but there's a good variety of potential coursework to take for sure. If you're looking at law school and want a 4.0 I would potentially recommend doing environmental studies rather than environmental science. The environmental chemistry course is definitely kinda rough and generally has to have a massive curve although I have a friend who is environmental science and pre-law and she made a good enough of a GPA to get accepted into law school. It just really depends on how much 'hard science' you personally want to do. I would also say that Baylor's ENV program is definitely less science and more environment in general. I definitely do not regret my decision to go the environmental science route as it has prepared me better for graduate school.\n\nAll this to say it is definitely a smaller environmental program but the faculty are great and there is excellent research being done here if you are interested in getting involved in that.",

I am Hispanic, eye brow slit, bald faded, and tattoos. Therefore, I do believe I am not viewed the same as say a white male Christian student. However, I did not come to this school to be make lots of friends go on study abroad and or even experience the college life. I am here to learn and go home. So it does not bother me the way I am viewed because I see a lot of copy and paste of the same looking people all over campus. I\u2019m in loads of debt that the school did claim that would help with and if I\u2019m being honest, that shit is not true. The Rec center is bad and so is the dining hall food. Again I say\u2026 if you are only here to get a great education then YES Baylor is a great option. If you want the full experience I strongly suggest looking in to other schools.

        "body": "You should always apply to a bunch of schools. If you want to go to Baylor, you should. But you shouldn't go anywhere because it is your only option.\n\nROTC claims to pay for your education, but you really have to dive into what the asterisk on that payment will be. Will they cover all your tuition, book costs, room and board, and spending money? Generally not. My tuition was fully covered by scholarships, but just paying for room and board is why I graduated with $50k in student loans. Many of the \"benefits\" of ROTC programs are actually just in the form of the paycheck you get after college by working in the military, just like a normal job. In my mind, the program paying for things is not necessarily worth what you miss out on by not being able to be a normal college student doing normal college things (not to mention the profound moral implications). If you could afford a cheaper school without joining ROTC, I would go there myself.\n\nI have a lot of mixed feelings about Baylor. I made many dear friends there, I got to explore Europe and meet my wife because of my relationships with Baylor professors who worked magic to make it free for me, and I got my first job based on the fact that I graduated from the honors program. But I would have made dear friends anywhere I went, probably would have still gotten to do a semester abroad with great professors, and had connections that got me a different first job. I am happy for the particularities of my life, but it wasn't fate that those particularities happened at Baylor and couldn't have happened elsewhere.\n\nI'll say that the particular negatives I experienced were unique to Baylor. I was harassed for being different. I couldn't be everything God made me to be. I was left on the outside of many things because I didn't fit in. \n\nBut, on the other hand, those particular difficulties very much so made me who I am today. I wish I had been freer to explore the ideas I am only now exploring, but I wouldn't have had the same foundation without it. My ability to speak with people very different from me comes from surviving at Baylor.\n\nBut, on my third invisible hand, perhaps the person I would be having gone somewhere else would have been just as cool as I am but without so much debt. Rethinking these things is really hard. There was a lot of good at Baylor, but I think there was too much bad for me to say unequivocally that other people should go there. \n\nTL;DR: If you're a male white Christian middle-class conservative, you'll be fine at Baylor, but probably in debt. If you're not, I think there are places that will challenge you to grow without quite so much trauma. And above all, don't let the military manipulate you into anything.\n\nEdit: the autocorrect was wild.",

It took me a while to find my niche in college, and I started the semester before covid hit the world, so I genuinely was thinking about transferring. Decided to wait it out a semester, during which time I was finishing up the pre-reqs in my major, and I swear, that is the only reason I stayed. Ended up making most of the best friends I have now in the spring semester of my sophomore year (still very, very dear friends with three of those people), and the following two years, I was able to take history classes I loved with great professors. You'll probably need to take some history, especially if you're going through ROTC, and I truly believe that department is the hidden gem of the university.\n\nI'm also a secondary major in the English department, and honestly, I hate it there, but I have too many credits to drop that major now. Any university will be great as long as you find your people, and I happened to find mine through the history department. I can't speak to the STEM fields, though, only the humanities.\n\nEdit: to be clear, the English department also has wonderful people. I simply much prefer my history studies to my English studies",

Baylor keep closing more just-off-campus free parking every year, forcing students to buy on campus parking passes, which they still sometimes oversell. They often change the course requirements of each class which forces them to pay more. It just doesn\u2019t feel like a place where the administration is committed to caring about the students. It did when I was a freshman. But it doesn\u2019t any more.\n\nThis IS just my experience and perspective though, and it might not be other people\u2019s.",

I'm a history major myself, and I changed my major four times \u2014 added and dropped even after I added history, but once I added that, it hasn't changed for nearly three years now. A truly wonderful department that genuinely cares about their students, their fields of research, and their colleagues. While Baylor isn't known for history in the ways that Ivy Leagues are, most of the professors are actual leading experts in their fields who have worked with, been advised by, or befriended major historians in their fields.\n\nObviously, I can't speak to STEM, but I was a lit major for a bit and a professional writing major, as well as (briefly) a journalism major.

If Baylor is your top choice, wait for the letter and then fly down to see it. It was probably worth the 50k I spent to be there, learn a bunch about myself and my interests, meet a lot of cool intellectual heroes, get the connections that got me into graduate school, find the church that made me feel at home, and sent me to Europe (mostly) for free where I met my wife. But if it was to cost me double that, I wouldn't be able to afford to keep up with my student debt repayments and my life would be unimaginably difficult. \n\nTL;DR: If you have to take out loans for anywhere close to 25k in your first year, it isn't worth it.",

I took out the maximum public loan and additional private loans, which are currently on freeze. The private loans cost me just under $500 a month, and I still owe them about $17k. Unless my degree suddenly becomes worth a lot more money, I am probably going to be paying this off for at least another decade.\n\nAll that to say: See what offer Baylor gives you. Then you need to decide for yourself if potentially paying that off for the next two decades is worth it. It might be for you! But that's not something I'm qualified to help with here.",

The first year my package was probably only covering 60%, but the longer I kept up my GPA, participated in my honors and major's programs, and added value to campus life by leading and forming clubs, the more I got.

To that end, we wanted to address information about the scholarship competition.

You will receive the essay prompt in a follow-up email after the event, and the essay is due by February 20, 2023, at 5:00 PM CST.\n \nYear after year, we hear great feedback regarding this event, and we look forward to thinking through the complexities of this scenario* with you.

Almost everyone we have offered has also been offered by TCU.  Having a Natty and stringing together great draft classes would hurt our ability to compete for the same recruits. The damage inflicted thus far this year was bad enough, we don\u2019t need them dangling the CFP trophy out there as a carrot. \n\n2) Realignment is coming\u2026a TCU team with a natty would have the option to split off and do it\u2019s own thing on the next shuffle. As it stands now, baylor and TCU would likely be a strong package deal. Baylor offers almost nothing from a TV viewership POV, so we may need that Fort Worth market to help us down the road. \n\n3) TCU managed to keep Baylor out of the CFP in 2021 when Bohanon threw that boneheaded INT at the end of the game. We failed to return the favor this year when TCU managed to knock down a walk-off on our home turf. For that alone I am glad they lost.",

I didn\u2019t have the best GPA first year, but as the classes got harder my grades got better and med school admissions loved this! You need to take advantage of the resources baylor provides, SI is an enormous grade booster, office hours as well. It is a lot of effort to do well in pre med classes but if you want to, baylor is the right place to help you!! Def talk to your professors or dept chairs.",

This was Phil Knight's doing in providing the money, not Nike. Phil Knight is a huge donor to Oregon, he gave Novosad the huge check (rumors are close to $5M), not Nike. I can see how that gets confusing as he co-founded Nike & is chairman emeritus. If one of Baylor's huge donors had matched or exceeded Knight, would you still be as upset? NIL is currently the Wild West & until it's reformed, it will continue to be that way. I'm pissed about it too, but AN had been showing his lack of integrity for a while.

So yeah, I don't think it was his primary consideration. \n\nLots of reports on the point to be Oregon's new coordinator Will Stein, the former UTSA offensive coordinator whom had a solid pre existing relationship with Austin Novosad. Not to mention Oregon has a much stronger history of placing QBs in the NFL, a more talented overall roster, and are showing much better QB development than we are. All this on top of just being a more prestigious program with more eyeballs on it in the first place. Its not crazy to think those things play a role in a decision.\n\nRegardless Baylor still needs to step up their NIL game if we want to stay competitive from a recruiting standpoint. Its the way the game is played now, adapt or die.",

You've potentially dragged in the primary funding source for 20+ labs, many of which that aren't even in the BSB. You have most certainly raised more than a few eyebrows in the science department by now. Guidelines for raising lab animals are strict, but do not account for personal relationships formed between researchers and model. \n\nThe most I see happening is a revision of the lab manual to make it explicitly clear that lab rats will be killed. It's an unfortunate truth that the use of vivo animal models are necessary in research, and yes, behavioral studies are research.  \n\nPlease take a step back and realize the risk you're exposing yourself to.",

I plugged in the route and they actually have a bus that goes directly to DFW from the gas station right next to campus (the Exxon). I have never ridden this bus before or used this company, but might be worth looking into as it would be **much** better than what I described below. Hope this helps. \n\n~~I took the Greyhound *to* Waco a few years ago so I can't speak exactly of the way up, but I would honestly not have done it again just based on how complicated it was at the time. The bus terminal in Dallas is pretty jenk, but you won't be there long anyway if you're going up to Dallas. The buses are reliable but logistically you'll have to get from Baylor to the Waco bus terminal, then from the Dallas terminal to the DART (5 min walk), and then the DART to DFW (~55min on the orange line).~~",

It also helps to have an elite defense. The wrs this year can't make plays unless they get perfectly thrown passes and shapen is late/underthrowing his passes when he isn't missing wide-open receivers. I think his decision-making is a step too slow and his deep ball isn't good enough to take the top off. Shapen was good last year despite his inexperience because he had a great supporting cast. \n\nThe reality is we aren't a blue blood and we aren't going to have elite athletes every year. It's going to take time to develop our young guys and get back to conference title contention. I think Baylor fans need to manage their expectations better. We have been extremely lucky to see so much winning and relevance in the past 10 years considering where the program came from the 10 years previous to that. \n\nMy prediction is Baylor is going to have a few down years before they have a roster capable of doing something like they did in 2019/2021 and something like tcu is doing now.",

I learned a lot from Great Texts, and I think an understanding of the prevailing themes of classical and medieval literature can be surprisingly useful knowledge to have. If Great Texts sounds like something you might enjoy, then honors might be for you.\n\nCompared to BIC or University Scholars, the base Honors Program doesn't switch up a degree plan very much, so I think it comes down to if the differences sound worthwhile.",

There was a SINGLE recruit left in his class and Rhule had like 2 months to fill out the class. So a lot of the guys he worked with and developed weren't the type of guys that necessarily even fit his system as much as were players he could get. Rhule never had a win against a ranked opponent while at Baylor. \n\nAranda took RIGHT before COVID which def made recruiting and installing the system a much rougher journey under normal circumstances. 2020 only being 9 games def didn't help. One could argue a single mistake around QB or OC staffing decisions has cost Baylor 2-3 games this year. \n\nBoth coaches were awarded B12 coach of the year. Both took a team to the Sugar Bowl.

        "body": ">1) Better X's and O's guy?\n\nProbably Aranda. This isn't a slight against Rhule though. Aranda has been called by some people the smartest defensive mind in football. Not just college football but football in general. Rhule's background has involved him being a position coach at pretty much every position. He strikes me as a \"jack of all trades, master of none\" type. Which can actually be really beneficial for a head coach.\n\n>2) Better at player development? \n\nUntil proven otherwise, this has to go to Rhule. He put together the bulk of the 2019 and 2021 teams that made the Big 12 title games and Sugar Bowls.\n\n>3) Better at recruitment? \n\nThere's really no way to compare them here. The 2023 class Aranda is putting together might be the best Baylor class of the modern recruiting era. But he's also in a much more favorable position than Rhule ever was because Baylor is further away from scandal. It's possible that Aranda's resume (a national championship as a coordinator and a Big 12 title as a head coach) draws the attention of a caliber of recruit that Rhule never really had a chance at. But Rhule was also excellent at identifying underrated recruits with raw talent.\n\n>4) Better overall?\n\nAgain, I don't think you can make an apples-to-apples comparison here. I'd say that Rhule was maybe the best possible coach to take over after the scandal of the previous regime. But he also made no secret of his desire to eventually coach in the NFL. Aranda, on the other hand, is probably the better long-term fit. He's probably better at adapting to the changing landscape of college sports and he seems much more interested in leading young men, both on and off the football field.",

And he had a better overall receiving core than Shapen this year. \n\nRedshirt Freshman Shapen showed he was a better passer than 4th year developed Bohanon last year, and it was little surprise Shapen won the QB battle in the Spring.\n\nDoes that mean I'm happy with the QB play this year? Definitely not. Shapen has a tendency to Hero Ball, and has made some very notable mistakes. But he's also working with much less than Bohanon was last year. \n\nThis post reeks of \"our record was much better last year than this year, so clearly Bohanon was the better QB.\"",

It's OK if they have a \"bad\" season, meaning they aren't going to a big bowl game or whatever. Bowl games weren't even a THING in the 90s. I remember a couple of the players being in my French class one semester, and they were beyond excited to go the Builder's Square Alamo Bowl! The campus has some milestones then - first bowl game in a while, first dance on campus, stuff like that. So if you take in some perspective, it's all good to have a middle-of-the-road season when one considers the body of Baylor Football as a whole.\n\nDave Aranda is a treasure of a coach, and you'll probably find the Gen X alum like me saying the same as I did above: have patience. Sure, some changes can be made for next year, but we're in the last week or two of the season, and making wide-sweeping changes seem rather unintuitive to me.\n\nTrust in the program, I say. It's way better than in decades past, and I'm excited when I see my Bears have a winning season, which we are heading toward if we keep pushing hard!",

I believe most users perceived/downvoted you as saying ' We sucked in the '90s so it's okay to suck now' then perverballially throwing up your hands and [saying](https://wompampsupport.azureedge.net/fetchimage?siteId=7575&v=2&jpgQuality=100&width=700&url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.kym-cdn.com%2Fphotos%2Fimages%2Fnewsfeed%2F000%2F645%2F713%2F888.jpg) ' It's because you're young you can't possibly understand'. It's not pleasant to perceive you're being told your opinion/ perspective don't matter because of something you can't control.\n\n I REALLY Aranda,  he's a first time FBS coach and those guys always have growing pains, that's why most are lamenting the mistakes of Grimes and Shapen much more than trying to put Aranda in a hot seat. I really appreciate Arandas ethics and focus on culture. Even if it was a mistake to let Gerry know He wouldn't start early enough to let him transfer was an incredibly classy move. That's a guy who really cares about the kids in his program, I can't remember the last time I've seen a coach do that. Additionally He strikes me as a man who thinks deeply before he speaks and that's very rare these days.\n\nI'm excited to see them go to a bowl as well, I don't get the negative viewpoint of /r/CFB around the insane amount of bowls these days. I think it's really cool they found a way to offer the kids away to visit and experience a city they usually haven't been to before and provide them with a bit of team building. Activities and swag. From a football perspective, it's key to have those extra weeks to help work on the younger guys development. \n\nLol, those cheering for an OC switch with two games left are either using clumsy wording or flat out Don't understand how long it takes to implement different offensive systems. \n\nit's strange, Baylor has been such a bipolar football team record wise I don't think a lot of newer fans know what to do with middling seasons; ever since 2017 it's been seasons of dramatic improvement or absolutely hitting rock bottom. Really The last middling season we had was a decade ago with Florence, the grove year was openly thrown out of spite and I wouldn't include it.\n\nI would note that in the '90s the Bowl Coalition was formed, But that there were definitely various bowls before that. Just not in the BCS era type format most people are used to.\n\nedit: gave you a cute little reddit dancing crab and wanted to apologize for my snarkiness.",

I thought the Bears were back after 3 straight solid wins, and primed to close out the season with 3 big wins, or at minimum, 2 wins (K-State and UT) and a good loss to TCU.  But the K-State game was awful.  Had everything to play for (Big 12 Championship berth), on their home field, and came out and did what they did.\n\nIf TCU were going to lose in the regular season, they'd have done it by now.  The Playoff Committee, in their obvious bias against the Big 12, would love nothing more than to rank TCU lower than #4, even lower than a 1-loss team such as their Golden Boy Alabama.  The fact that they haven't, means they think TCU is pretty legit.\n\nI just don't see TCU losing, unless Baylor somehow manages to play the best game of their season, and TCU is a little flat.\n\nEDIT:  I would have been wrong had I bet.  Was a much more competitive game from Baylor than I expected.  Did not expect Baylor to be in a position to win this game.  Kudos to the team for almost beating a top team.",

If they could have beaten K-State, they could go and lose to TCU, and if they then beat UT to close out the season, that would have put them into the Big 12 Championship game, regardless of what K-State did the rest of the way, because they'd have the tie-breaker over K-State.  Had a potential Big 12 title game berth to play for, and they play the worst they've played all year, scoring 3 points on their home field!  Just completely unacceptable for a team that was seemingly on the rise, having won 3 straight.  I have to say I'm done watching them for the year after that, at least the regular season.  Might catch a bowl game if they play in one.  I'll try to catch some of the remaining marquee games, like the SEC championship (Georgia v LSU), Ohio State v Michigan (2 times possibly, not sure how the Big 10 works and their schedules), and I'll probably watch the Big 12 championship (looking like TCU v K-State).  But that's it.  Not interested in watching Baylor anymore this season, after that kind of result when they had everything to play for, on their home field, and they showed up and did that.\r  \n\r  \nYeah, the tipped pass interception on the first drive was a harbinger of things to come.  When I saw that, I had the feeling it was going to be a bad evening for them.  And then #34 drops the pass at the 4 yard line with the 1st half winding down, and they could have taken a shot for a TD after that and cut it to 17-7 going into the half, but instead had to settle for a field goal.\"\n\n(Baylor alum, '01, Engineering)",

George's is a great local restaurant. The silos are pretty cool if you're into that type of thing. There's a huge outdoor area to hang out and they have food trucks.

Christian identity is the third wheel at Baylor, and a sizable fraction of students come to Baylor for exactly that. As with teaching and research, some professors focus on spiritual mentorship more than others. My field's subject matter (geology) is inherently less relational than something like social work, so there was a definite expectation that teaching and research would take priority. Even so, I think I have been able to serve students better by equipping myself for substantive discussions on topics like the age of the Earth, [paleoseismology of Amos 1:1](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2020GL090947), etc. That's more or less what I discussed in the Statement of Faith.",

If you're a student and sent to a disciplinary hearing, this sort of stuff is open season, but you wouldn't believe who pays private school tuition and then says things that just don't fit.  People tried to tell me they were very fundamentalist, but in truth, I never saw it.  Just makes it easier for them to make a faster decision if someone doesn't agree with a fundamental tenet of the place.",

The service operated with a number of waivers to the Texas Department of Health regulations regarding being available 24x7x365 (campus closes during some holidays) and EMS transport to hospitals (the Health Center is not licensed as a hospital). The weight of those waivers along with legal pressures of a perceived liability risk caused the University to shut down the service. In the interim the University has sponsored a health professionals club and has the FAST team that performs first aid for injuries at intramural events. That appears to be the limit of what the University is willing to support.\n\nAs for the club you want to start, keep in mind the past history. If you\u2019re looking for a place to use your scope of practice as an EMT, you\u2019re probably limited to the FAST team and whatever the health professions club supports. If you\u2019re just looking for a place to gather with people who have similar interests to do continuing education or discuss evolving practice in EMS then you might get some support. I would start with talking to Student Activities to understand the process and talking your ideas up with faculty who could serve as your advisor. Without the support of those two groups, your group is unlikely to get official support or recognition from the University.",

Hard to overstate how huge losing him would be.\n\nStill disappointed in the defense, Walcott in particular. Really think we need to move him back to CB and stop trying to reinvent Pitre (his best play of the day was a pass breakup). He's just not able to leverage any pressure on the QB at all.\n\nEdit: one more observation - Reese is our most exciting true freshman on offense since KD Cannon.

He helped fix our offense last year after it was *terrible* in Aranda's first season.\n\nHis big thing is wide zone run schemes, which basically means that instead of blocking outwards from a specific hole, the o-line blocks sideways and the running back runs horizontally until a hole appears, then does a plant-and-go. The pass game seems to be pretty standard modern pass concepts with a lot of play action.\n\nHe's a stellar o-line coach; we've gone from one of the worst in the conference to one of the best under him, and I think that was his position coaching role before becoming our OC.\n\nWhat I've also liked about him is how he's adapted his playcalling to who is on the field instead of forcing next-man-up to a system too tightly.\n\nJumping all the way to head coach would be a pretty meteoric rise, but he has the tactical acumen to do so. I would prefer to keep him and would lie to you if it helps do so, but somehow I don't think the Auburn OC is reading my reddit comments so... enjoy lol.\n\nThat said, beware that Baylor has a metric fuckton of money dedicated to coaching salaries now, and it's not as easy to pry a coach away from here as it used to be. Auburn easily has the funds to do it if they decide that's the best option, but it would likely require substantial investment--and therefore substantial *confidence* from the money-givers.",

Grimes has never hidden that last year\u2019s offense was a stepping stone to a more pass-oriented offense like he ran at BYU, and he and his offensive assistants were very open in the offseason about their excitement about opening up the passing game this year. They made the decision relatively early in spring camp to switch to Shapen this year over staying with Bohanon, which was a very decisive shift toward the passing QB over the rushing QB, which locked us into that schematic pivot, but this season has made it very clear that our WR corps isn\u2019t where it needs to be to support this heavy of a shift to the passing game. All but one of our starting WRs are underclassmen, and Gavin Holmes singlehandedly lost the OKST game with all of his drops, not to mention his genuinely swinging a catch into an interception at the goal line. Tyquan Thornton *was* our downfield passing game last year, and now he\u2019s with the Patriots.\n\nOur WR corps could\u2019ve benefitted immensely from another year of gradual progression toward the passing game, and our entirely returned OL could\u2019ve made that happen, but instead Grimes and co. wanted to get over to a passing offense that would theoretically be more explosive, and didn\u2019t take into consideration that our WR personnel couldn\u2019t currently support that. Now we\u2019ve spent the last four games backtracking and trying to do more of what we did last year, but Shapen\u2019s not the terrifically physical rusher that Bohanon was, and our RBs are all young as well.\n\nThe OL can keep Shapen in a clean pocket all day long, but the WRs aren\u2019t getting separation like they\u2019d need to for Grimes\u2019 ideal offense to work like it did at BYU, and then when they do get separation, they\u2019re dropping balls relatively often. They\u2019re young, so that\u2019ll change over time as they develop, but they\u2019re not there yet. Our only very strong offensive performances so far have been against a bad G5 team, a bad FCS team, and WVU, who has a really bad defensive secondary. OKST shut us the hell down for three quarters, and BYU clamped down so hard in the passing game that we basically gave up passing in the second half and tried to run last year\u2019s scheme with a RS FR at RB, trying to do what Abram Smith did as a senior.\n\nThis is explicitly a case of pushing toward a scheme that our personnel can\u2019t currently support, rather than making a gradual shift based on strengths of the players that we actually have.",

I\u2019ve worked with plenty of EE\u2019s writing high level software and doing nothing with hardware, while I (a CS major) spent most of my career writing embedded firmware. If you\u2019re smart and work hard you can learn whatever you need to get the job you want with either major. Your compensation also depends more on your negotiating skills than it does on your major. You can even switch to the other field for your graduate degree if needed. Just talk to graduate admissions early if your thinking about that. You have a lot more flexibility than you might realize.\r  \n\r  \nThat said, it is important for you to discover what you enjoy doing and let that dictate which one you choose. You could spend some time researching the courses required for each program or even try both. Pick one as your major and the other as your minor. If you look at the degree plan flow charts, there\u2019s quite a bit of overlap the first 3 semesters so you should be able to switch majors easily and you can always drop the minor if you discover it\u2019s not for you.  \r  \n\r  \nYou\u2019ll be assigned an advisor to help you schedule your courses and they might be able to offer better advice on how to try both and make sure you still graduate on time. One thing that helped me was to take a lot of electives at a community college during the summer and transfer the credits over. This let me pack my schedule with the \u201cgood\u201d stuff. I was able to take quite a few more math and CS courses this way.\r  \n\r  \nHope this helps. They\u2019re tough majors, but well worth it and a lot of fun!",

Ask some people who know you personally what they think is notable about your accomplishments. Sometimes what other people were impressed by is something you thought was really easy and forgot about. You can also mention anything that is unique to Baylor that you are excited about.\n\nEarly action/early decision might help you get in. Baylor is your first choice, so you should do it. Them receiving your application sooner rather than later probably helps more.\n\nI don't remember which designation I applied under, since I wasn't 100% sure Baylor was my choice until much later, so I'm sure whatever I picked didn't imply commitment. I can see from my emails that I finalized my application on November 24 and the acceptance came through December 3. This was in 2015, I'm sure they have more applicants these days, and it takes longer.\n\nAs an additional piece of advice, lookup the scholarships you can get from Baylor based on your SAT/ACT score. If you're right on the edge somehow, it might be worth taking the test one more time to get more scholarship money.",

There is of course a sense in which the person at the top is responsible for a vaguely defined \u201ccampus culture\u201d, but the PH report presumably didn\u2019t find that Starr had any substantive involvement, and the BoR accordingly didn\u2019t call for resignation. It was only after a public outcry that Starr was pushed to resign, and some more outcry for him to resign from the Law school.\n\nThat public outcry was largely motivated by Ken Starr\u2019s polarizing career in politics, particularly the juicy irony of his involvement with the sexual harassment accusations against Bill Clinton. I think that is borne out by the vitriol in this thread.",

Something like half of them could drop-out, fail classes, etc. and it doesn't even make a dent in metrics compared to a handful of the fall-admitted students doing the same thing.",

Because it worked. The fact is that a lot of people are overreacting to his play calling after this game specifically that were not in the past. I take your point that you have been disappointed with this play calling for longer though.\n\nI think especially after the Briles era and the Rhule era this fan base has gotten accustomed to trick plays and misdirection, because both of those coaches tended to be more comfortable taking risks.

Also, even the announcers last week mentioned our playbook was quite conservative as to not show our cards for bigger games. At the time, I agreed but hindsight we were even more restrictive than the week prior for some unknown reason. You don't have to run a statue of liberty as a trick play, but you have to show some sort of understanding that you need a big play to keep the defense honest. While the design of the Sims TE pass at the end was clever, that was essentially one time we used the 50 running attempts to lure the defense into guessing. BYU was just stacking the box and shooting gaps. Our conservative play calling and risk adverse play calling is good when we're the more talented team but that's not going to fly in games against Texas, OkSt, and OU.",

I said our offensive play calling was sufficient that it did not cost us 12 wins.\n\nWe still have a defense that supports that type of play. I mentioned that in my PGR above, that we had many chances to win this game and that's due in large part to our defense. With the exception of 2 or 3 drives, our defense really stepped up against BYU. Our offense just didn't step up when we needed them to. And I will again point out that Shapen appeared to be injured, and Monaray Baldwin and Taye McWilliams did as well. Add the absolute mountain of flags thrown to that, and you have a recipe for disaster. All of which indicates that Grimes was at least hamstrung on the plays he was willing to call.",

As much as possible, be calm and clear with your needs. Be as thankful and courteous as possible. Don't raise your voice or lose your temper, which I know could be difficult given the seriousness of the situation and how frustrating the world feels.\n\nI've worked at a number of different institutions, and people would be really surprised at how far staff are willing to go to help a student in need, especially if that student is nice/thankful for the help.

Apparently, you can enroll in the military but if you have health conditions like asthma or adhd, you won't get deployed out of the US. And this is only a summer thing. You get $50,000 upfront and $5,000 every month that you're in med school. Every summer during med school, you'll be deployed in the US.

[For decades now, Baylor has been the training place of Baptist leadership both nationwide and globally](https://www.texasmonthly.com/articles/the-war-for-thee-university/amp/), and the BGCT is the Baptist conference that maintains an exclusive governance relationship with Baylor. This quote, from the 1991 article linked above, is gonna sound awfully familiar to anyone familiar with the modern Baptist polity:\n\n>For the past twelve years, two antagonistic, irreconcilable groups of Baptists\u2014popularly known as fundamentalists and moderates\u2014have been at war over theology, politics, and culture. The fundamentalists believe that the Bible contains no errors and want to return to the old-time religion of past generations, while the moderates believe each individual is his own priest and can interpret the Bible for himself. It\u2019s a lot more complicated than that, of course, as is everything about the Baptists, but one thing is clear. Fundamentalists are in power, and they want control of Baylor, the only Baptist treasure that has eluded them. Throughout the Southern Baptist domain, fundamentalists elect the important officials, control the seminaries, write the Sunday school books, and occupy the major pulpits. Baylor is all the moderates have left, and they are determined to keep it.\n\nAnd on Baylor\u2019s importance to the Baptist world:\n\n>Baylor is to Baptists what Notre Dame is to Catholics. Groups of Baptists make regular trips to Baylor\u2019s 428-acre campus, built along the Brazos River, and proudly point to the Pat Neff Hall, Old Main, and Armstrong-Browning Library as sacred shrines. Moderates and fundamentalists can\u2019t agree about what to call each other\u2014they fight over who are the real conservatives\u2014but they all refer to Baylor by the same nicknames: Thee University, Jerusalem on the Brazos, the Baylor Bubble, the Crown Jewel.\n\nThis was immediately in the aftermath of Baylor split with the more fundamentalist SBC, in favor the more moderate BGCT, after the SBC made repeated moves toward increasing their power over Baylor\u2019s on-campus operations. In the decades since, the BGCT has followed a similar path toward fundamentalism and a pattern of encroaching attempts at influencing Baylor\u2019s operations. For all of his many, many faults, Ken Starr did successfully pull Baylor farther from the BGCT\u2019s clutches, and Dr. Linda has continued that trend while walking a narrow line between offending the increasingly fundamentalist Baptist world and the mainstream, largely secular, academic society that Baylor needs to earn respect from.\n\nBaylor gains functionally nothing by a formal relationship with the BGCT, while the BGCT\u2019s gain is immense. As a former academic administrator (at another major institution here in Texas, not at Baylor), I would be very surprised if Baylor\u2019s administration didn\u2019t have their eye on an arrangement more like what Duke and SMU have with the Methodist church, where they\u2019re still related, but the church has no influence or explicit hand in the schools\u2019 governance structures.",

Baylor was historically *very* focused on undergraduate pedagogical excellence, and passed on the opportunity to build a major research wing in the post-WWII university research funding boom. Nowadays, universities cover a substantial portion of their costs with the standard administrative cut from grants earned by faculty, and schools without major research wings are left to attempt to make up the difference on their increasing operational costs by increasing tuition and soliciting donations. As a former higher ed administrator myself, that donor pool isn\u2019t bottomless, and the relationship between tuition cost and enrollment is an inverted parabola. There\u2019s a maximum tuition ar any point in time that can be charged before you start losing students and your net revenue decreases.\n\nBaylor *needs* to be viable in the modern research space. Having worked very closely with TCU\u2019s IR people during my time with UNT, I can promise you that their lack of a research wing is *tremendously* concerning to the institutional leadership. That\u2019s why they just bought UNTHSC out of the UNT-TCU joint medical school, they want to fire up a clinical research wing and all of the boku research grant bucks that come with clinical research activity. If TCU can\u2019t get that research activity wing up to a point that it\u2019s helping to mitigate their operational costs within the decade, it\u2019s hardly excessive to say that the university\u2019s going to be at least approaching insolvent by 2040. Baylor, on the other hand, has made considerably more headway than TCU in developing a research wing that generates adequate revenues and helps build the institutional reputation, which itself attracts more students.\n\nWe\u2019re at the point now where Baylor\u2019s close ties to a socially regressive organization are making Baylor\u2019s forward progress as a research institution increasingly difficult, and they\u2019re a turnoff to the vast majority of researchers of the caliber that Baylor both wants and needs to attract to continue this progress.\n\nI\u2019s be surprised if Baylor\u2019s administration weren\u2019t eying a relationship like what the Methodist Church has with Duke and SMU: an association that doesn\u2019t include any hand in university operations or governance beyond the church\u2019s approval in the school\u2019s seminary.\n\nEdit: Got the long end of the autocorrect stick.

His jokes, analogies, etc. are all hilarious, too. \n\nI will be real tho, his class might be a bit tough if you\u2019re on the weaker end with Latin, but he\u2019s very understanding and wants all his students to do well.",

But you asked, so here goes.\n\nI was the first non-conservative person a lot of people had met. In their minds, liberals (which is not a term I would use for myself now) were crazy people. I was constantly accidentally converting people away from their beliefs because I would point out some way that their very shallow worldview fell apart, and that resulted in a lot of people disliking me. It's fine to dislike me; there are a lot of good reasons to dislike me. But the fact that my existence challenges your worldview probably shouldn't be one of them.\n\nI was also the first even vaguely Jewish person most people had met. I was at that time praying about converting and considered myself to be an interfaith Christian and Jew (something I now recognize is not really possible from a properly Jewish perspective). I would wear my kippah around campus on holy days, and I received a lot of antisemitic hate in my direction. \n\nWhen I dated a Black woman, we got a ton of odd looks. The assumption at Baylor is that Black students are all student-athletes, and student-athletes' apartments are literally separated (segregated) from the rest of the campus. The fact that I was dating a Black woman led to all sorts of comments, assumptions, and some really vile racism.\n\nNone of that gets into the way Baylor essentially blamed student-athletes (a nice Baylor code for Black students) for the huge rape issue on campus, when the vast majority of rapes were and are committed by people involved in the majority white Greek life on campus.\n\nThat epidemic is made worse by the fact that Baylor's policy that \"you are a container\" of alcohol means you don't have a safe place to retire if you live on campus and chose to drink. It's not as if drinking is not happening on campus or just off of campus, and those rules only make the situation something administration doesn't have to deal with rather than taking proactive steps to protect Baylor students.\n\nAnd don't even get me started on realizing you're queer there.\n\nThere are a lot of things I love about Baylor. I could write similar paragraphs about the religion department, Boho, the honors college, and everything Baylor had to teach me. But unfortunately, a lot of those lessons were in how *not* to build community. Only when Baylor deals seriously with the racism, sexism, homophobia, and fear of engaging with people who are different would I ever consider sending my kid there.",

That distinction is important to realizing that you'll find a lot of solidarity even with Christians who don't share that background or priorities. But you can also build relationships with people who do represent that kind of Christianity when you realize that you do actually share some values with them and emphasize those values in those relationships.\n\nMore importantly though, clubs helped me a lot. I ended up becoming the president of the Baylor Dems, and that connected me with pretty much everyone who didn't fit into that very particular Baylor bubble.

Up in Fort Worth, just off TCU\u2019s campus feels like a college is meant to be there. \n\nWaco doesn\u2019t have any of that. We are bound by a triangle of borders (I35, the river, and La Salle, which runs into 35 to complete the triangle.) Inside this triangle is 2 things: campus and housing. Essentially no commercial life that is fun for students. It has no life. It feels dead. Outside of this triangle is more or less strictly locals. College towns, especially in the immediate vaccinate of campus, should be energetic and exciting. \n\nSure you can call Waco a college town because it is a town that is based around a college, but by no means does it have the feel of a college town.",

        "body": "Cell bio and organic chemistry are definitely harder than your typical freshman classes. If you struggle with time management, I would avoid working/choose a position that allows you to study on shift, i.e working the SUB, Moody, etc. I wrote some advice a while back in response to some DMs about Ochem:\n\n\nOchem/Zinke FAQ:\n\n**How are Gen Chem and Orgo different?**\n\nJames Amherst covers this better than anybody on his [site](https://www.masterorganicchemistry.com/2010/06/28/gen-chem-and-organic-chem-how-are-they-different/). \n\n**I'm lowkey terrified of this class, should I study ahead?**\n\nNo. Enjoy your break. The first module of Ochem is Chem 1 review: Formal Charges, Bond Theory, Atomic Orbitals, Physical Properties, etc. Yes it gets harder but you will be eased into things.\n\n**I'm signed up to take Zinke--do you have any experience with him?**\n\nPlenty of people love Zinke, plenty others struggled in the class. I'm in the camp that thinks he's great! Check out what others think on [BUBooks](http://www.bubooks.com/profdisplay.php?profid=2382).\n\n**What materials do I need to buy?**\n\nBuy the Baylor editions of the Klein textbooks in the Bookstore--it's a softcover packaged with the answer book which has room to work through the problem sets & additional questions and is newly updated. You have to do these problem sets if you want to do on this class. The 4th edition differs from the 3rd, not by a lot, but enough. Molecular model kits are optional, but if you need one there are cheaper molecular model kits online. If you're cheap like me, just ask the SI's if you're really having trouble, or look up structures on PubChem.\n\n**What does doing well mean in Orgo?**\n\nThink about what your goals should be for the class. If you're pre-professional student chances are your priorities are: 1) Get an A. 2) Get a recommendation letter. 3) Learn the material. Of the 3, the 3rd is the hardest and requires the most time and effort. \n\n**What's the best way to study for Orgo?**\n\nPractice problems. Do them as you read through the textbook and do the recommended ones at the end of each chapter. Your enjoyment and understanding of Orgo is proportionate to the number of practice problems you are doing. Orgo is qualitative/conceptual, and learning these concepts is a discrete process. Make an effort to understand everything in Zinke's notes: anything in them is testable material. At first, they will look like gibberish. It is up to you to use supplemental texts and practice problems to master the concepts. If you can learn the material, you will get an A. Zinke's tests are very fair.\n\nAdditional Resources: I found Klein's supplemental texts to be invaluable: [*Organic Chemistry as a Second Language*](https://libgen.is/search.php?req=organic+chemistry+as+a+second+language&lg_topic=libgen&open=0&view=simple&res=25&phrase=1&column=def). [masteringorganicchemistry] (https://www.masterorganicchemistry.com/) is a great resource for comprehensive explanations. \n\n**What do you think is that main reason that people do badly?**\n\nThe most common mistake is to convincing yourself that you don't need to study as much as you know you should. Even worse is not admitting that you're struggling. Reach out for help  The plethora of free resources available at Baylor is an incredible privilege:  SI, Sid Rich tutoring, prof office hours. Use them! \n\n**How much time should I expect to spend on Orgo?**\n\n2-5 hours of out-of-class work for every hour in class. Personally, I stopped going to lectures a few weeks into Orgo 1 and used that time for practice problems. Keep yourself accountable but allocate time for other classes/free time. When you aren't spending time on OChem, don't be worrying about Ochem.",

IMO a physical textbook to mark up in is a necessity: you have to be drawing out the structures and mechanisms as you read about the concepts. Everything else you can find for free online. \n\nHere's the study plan that worked for me: Read Zinke's notes up to current lecture->**Understand** corresponding concepts with \"Organic Chemistry as a Second Language\"->Use Klein main textbook to master **applying** concepts to problems. 70% of ochem studying should be this last step. \n\nLast tip: Ochem SI is many times more valuable than actual lecture, and is where you actually get taught organic chemistry. Really try to go to all the sessions. Zinke is very close to his SIs and tells them what topics show up on upcoming exams. \n\nGood luck! It may seem like a lot but you got this!",

So there is a very real student community like a more residential school but it\u2019s located off campus on land not controlled by Baylor.\n2. Safe enough, but don\u2019t be stupid.  There are more than enough great bars to meet demand but the Baylor Bubble is real and leaves most students happy to move to bigger cities after graduation.  Those who actually get out and explore the area usually love it though.  I thought it was the perfect blend of city options, small town ease, and historic character.  But don\u2019t make college decisions based on what the town has to offer.  It is just as easy to be bored in New York or Austin as it is in Waco or Stillwater.  What matters to a good college experience is the friends you make.\n3. Not really.  Chapel and a bible core requirement are real, and I did see the guy dragging a cross around every day.  But Baylor is big enough that you can find all types there.  Just spend time with the kind of people you want to, and ignore the ones you don\u2019t.\n4. 15,000 unsupervised college age kids.  So yes.  The number of people who fail out due to partying is not any higher or lower than anywhere else.  My friends and I had a fantastic time both around campus and in the surrounding area.",

Most students live off-campus starting their sophomore year, and even the ones that live on campus know people they can visit. Apart from housing, there is plenty to do in Waco. It's not the most glamorous city, but the food is good, there's a big park nearby, and there's plenty of odd touristy places that are fun to visit once or twice. I think the real charm of Baylor, though, is what happens on campus, especially for Freshman. There are a lot of traditions events (Hoco, Christmas on Fifth, etc.), and you can always find things to do with other people on the campus. But there is a good balance, so you are not forced into going on or off campus for social activities.\n2. I think Waco is safe. I live right outside of Baltimore though, so my perception may be a little skewed. Obviously don't be stupid, it is still a city and college students are known for being unaware of their surroundings (especially me haha). And for things to do, see above.\n3. I went to a public high school for 12 years, so to me the Christian faith is more in your face than what I was used to. But, I wouldn't describe it as an issue, nor that \"in your face\". I am Christian, so I don't mind, but other than Chapel, two religious courses, what you'll find is that professors will sometimes bring up faith, students talk about faith a lot, and there are a lot of Christian groups that promote on campus. But I know people at all ranges on the faith spectrum, and people generally find their place.\n4. Yes, but not as much as other schools. I don't really know, I don't party, but they certainly exist. If you want to party you can, if you don't want to, nobody cares. So no matter what, it's not a real issue.\n\nFeel free to DM me if you have any questions!",

I wouldn't recommend walking in parts of the city you're not familiar with alone, especially at night, and especially if you're a woman. At night especially, its best to drive or travel in groups.\n3. No, the religious aspect is not \"in your face.\" I, and many others have spoken about this on this subreddit before. The religious features of Baylor's curriculum are taught from a secular POV.\n4. Not really. From what I can tell, you need to be \"in\" with the right crowd, most likely a frat/sorority in order to go to those giant college parties you see in movies. There aren't a lot of them at Baylor, and the school is a dry campus which makes things even harder. Baylor is a pretty academically serious institution so many of the students aren't necessarily partying on the weekends, especially during the semester.",

There\u2019s a lot of good restaurants and coffee shops though. Waco is also close to Dallas and Austin if you want to escape. Cameron park is pretty nice. Best not to go at night though. I will say waco is still growing and there\u2019s more and more places being built every year. \n\n2. Waco is tolerable but I wouldn\u2019t necessarily consider it \u201csafe.\u201d Waco has its nice areas like downtown but there\u2019s a lot of ghetto areas near campus and homeless people roaming the streets. They get annoying especially when you\u2019re just trying to go out and explore the town because they harass you for money. From my experience here, I feel like every week Baylor sends an email regarding a shooting off campus, a kidnapping, car thefts, armed robberies, etc. I was excited to come here because of the river and thought it would be something like UTSA where people would use it, but the Brazos river water isn\u2019t safe and no one gets in because of the pollution and bacteria. \n\n3. The religious aspect of Baylor isn\u2019t as intense as I thought. If it\u2019s your thing you\u2019ll come across several students who are religious and some will most likely recruit you to join there church. All the religious kids I\u2019ve met have been really friendly, but they\u2019re not really my group I like hanging around. You do have to take two religious courses during your 4 years and attend chapel but I took chapel online and it was asynchronous so it wasn\u2019t bad. \n\n4. Waco is not considered a party school but people do party and like to have the college experience. I will say there\u2019s only like 2 or 3 bars near campus that baylor students go to and the only times most students will go out is after a game or on something like St. Patrick\u2019s day. Most of the time there\u2019s more sketchy locals that go to the bars than students. You have better chances of having stuff to do by joining clubs or Greek life. Greek life here does throw parties frequently but there\u2019s no greek row with mansions. Instead it\u2019s old houses that parents have rented out for their kids and most of the time the parties are in the backyards because the houses are too small. It\u2019s not the same experience as other colleges with real greek life, but it\u2019s here if you want it.",

A lot of times you\u2019ll get sick of sugary junk food/dining hall food and need something plain and healthier. \n\nSomeone else suggested a rice cooker, which I think is super smart if you like rice. Easy zero-effort meals. I had a tiny single serving one that served me well. \n\nI survived off of trail mix one year. It\u2019s fairly high sugar though. \n\nProtein powder can be a good move as well. I like completely unflavored stuff because a lot of the sweeteners make me sick. \n\nI also always kept a big tub of Greek yoghurt in my fridge and some jam/honey. You can mix it together to get a flavor/level of sweetness you like. Plus it wastes less plastic than single-serve. \n\nEggs, bread, cheddar cheese, and oil plus a frying pan. Fried egg sandwiches were a staple for me. \n\nAnd a little reusable grocery bag to tote things back and forth from the kitchen. \n\nIt partially depends on how much you want to/are willing to cook. I like to cook so I always kept more ingredients around than complete meals. If you don\u2019t like to cook, look into TV dinners, prepared snacks, frozen burritos, hot pockets, things like that. You can also meal prep. I still make huge batches of beef and beans, and make a bunch of burritos out of them. Wrap in plastic wrap and freeze. Microwave in plastic when you need. They keep for maybe 4-6 months and are super handy. \n\nBest of luck to you!\n\nEdit: also some high fiber cereal. It\u2019s important to stay regular haha. I like oatmeal squares.",

        "body": "Graduated from the theatre program about six years ago as a designer, and my partner also graduated from the program as a costume designer. I can talk more about the design side, but a bunch of this also applies for performers:\n\nPros:\n\n- Strong technical training for both actors and designers. I was the ATD at a resident theatre in Dallas for a while after I got out, and I was incredibly disappointed by the quality of the technicians coming out of the TCU, UNT, DBU, and sometimes even SMU programs.\n\n- The network. Baylor folks in the Dallas theatre scene are pretty tightly-knit, so you usually always know someone, or can ask around to find a Baylor alum, at any of the companies in DFW. Getting that warm handoff to a person you want to interface with can be invaluable. I\u2019ve been a lecturer at UNT and SMU in the last few years, and their programs aren\u2019t even *remotely* as tightly-knit as the Baylor program, and I credit that to Friday workshop. Getting everyone in the same space to watch some theatre and support friends is an invaluable camaraderie-building mechanism.\n\n- Lack of a masters program for design or performance. This is one that you don\u2019t find out is a blessing until you see how rough it is at schools that *do* have those: their undergrads are eternally going to stay second priority behind their MFA students for any and all mainstage design and performance roles. It\u2019s not uncommon at all to see UT and SMU grads who had exactly zero mainstage work (and the accompanying mentorship) in their undergraduate four years. That\u2019s a whole period of development that they didn\u2019t get at all, and comparatively a huge advantage for Baylor. Most designers at BU graduate with 2~4 mainstage designs (more for scenic and aound designers) and one or two assistantships, and performers almost always graduate with a handful of mainstage roles under their belts.\n\nNow, for the cons:\n\n- Cost. May or may not be an issue, but Baylor is undeniably expensive.\n\n- Lack of an affiliated professional theatre. Waco\u2019s growing like crazy, and may eventually have a professional theatre company for Baylor to partner with, but for now it lacks one. SMU is partnered with DTC, and that\u2019s absolutely invaluable for the few very promising SMU students who get to work with DTC, because they to get access to the Dallas theatre scene and start building their networks early. To make up for this on Baylor\u2019s end, Steven Pounders, John-Michael Marrs, and Jordan Rousseau all *extremely* active and well-connected in Dallas, and I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever told anyone in the Dallas scene that I went to Baylor without them asking if I knew some combination of those three. If you\u2019re heading down to Austin, Jojo, JMM, and Ryan Joyner are much more active down thataway.\n\n\nOverall, I had a great time with the department and don\u2019t regret it at all, and I think my partner feels the same way. Feel free to PM me if you have any questions!",

You'll do an entire section on Hemoglobin and Myoglobin, and how they work. Instead of just trying to remember what they do, think about the reasons behind it. For example, hemoglobin needs high affinity for O2 in the lungs, and lower affinity in the bloodstream near your cells. Instead of just memorizing this, you want to think about why it makes sense. You need to get O2 in the lungs, and not retain it near oxygen depleted cells.

Like other students, I struggled as my family had cut some ties with me due to disagreements related to my sexuality. I had to find family at Baylor who would accept me. I want that opportunity to be there for others like me as well. Im happy to see that there are movements now to help make the campus more inclusive. We are still a ways away, but it\u2019s possible. Im now a doctoral student at the University of Houston and it\u2019s amazing seeing how much diversity and inclusion is here.

Verizon, AT&T, TMobile, etc- there\u2019s not really a comparison to be made regarding reception that I\u2019m aware of, they probably use the same towers and hardware anyways. As to deals, I\u2019d honestly just do some personal shopping around. I\u2019d go through and research what all each provider offers at different price points & figure out what system/perks look the best to you- what may be a deal to someone else might not really make sense or matter for you. Many companies in general also provide student discounts or student accounts with discounted rates for their services, and they may or may not be a solid deal depending on data offered/plan features (they almost always are in other fields, I\u2019ve never looked into phone plans though) \n\nAs an addendum, we\u2019ve also got a pretty solid campus wifi, AirBear, which is free and rolled out into all classroom spaces & dorms (and currently undergoing some upgrades as well!). Heck, I can get decent connectivity on fountain mall sometimes from the neighboring buildings.\n\nAs to freshman things? You should definitely not under no circumstances ever in the history of ever (wink) access the website https://z-lib.org/ because the \u201cbooks\u201d section of that website definitely does not have like 75% of the textbooks & manuals you\u2019ll ever need to buy for your classes.\n\nAlso make sure to inform your friends to absolutely never access the books section of that site for the same reasons. :)\n\nLast but not least, welcome to Baylor!",

It was hard. The amount of reading was brutal for me but workable for most. I am deeply grateful for the structure of it still 20\u2019years later.",

A couple of my favorites were: the summer before freshman year you get to go to line camp where you learn all about the school and meet friends and learn the campus, etc. At the end of line camp you all go out to the original Baylor campus in independence Texas where you learn about the history of the school. There is a big ceremony and each person gets to walk through the pillars and you are presented with your Baylor Line Jersey\u2026 this is the moment you forever become part of the Baylor family. The way they do it is sooooo special. My other favorite is running the Baylor line at the home football games. You get to wear your line jersey and run out on to the field before the game and then you get a special section of the seats saved just for you. And they are the best seats in the house\u2026 then as a senior, for your very last home game you get to join the freshman and you all run together for the last time. It is so special and memorable. And then homecoming\u2026. Oh my goodness. Sooooooo much special traditions and fun. Too much to even explain. But my goodness, the thing about Baylor is they always go above and beyond to make you feel included and like you have a place in their family. No matter who you are. It\u2019s amazing. Anyways, just a few of my favorite things\u2026 I honestly don\u2019t have enough room or time to tell you about all of it. I could go on for days.",

I am going into my 4th year being in the marching band (AKA the Golden Wave Band) and to me, it's the main thing that has made attending Baylor worth it for me. All of my friends are in band and all of my memories are from band / with band people. All of my roommates for the past 3 years have been people I met in band. I may be attending grad school in Colorado with 2 people I met in band. Every rehearsal, every hype gameday, every pop-up performance/pep rally, every basketball/volleyball/soccer game, every volunteer opportunity...all have changed my life for the better.

Don't believe anyone when they say it is \"good debt.\" It still will impact creditors when they decide if you can afford a car, house or even an apartment. So if you want those things, you will have to be very disciplined in order to build good credit so that they are willing to overlook your student loan debt amount.\n\nSo...\n\nI sincerely hope you can find a solution - like a smaller loan in combination with a payment plan, but if not, please know that it is likely a blessing in disguise.",

        "body": "Personally, if it\u2019s financially viable, the ease of just being able to get up and stumble to a dining hall on the weekends was really nice- especially if life just gets stressful for whatever reason and you don\u2019t have the proper time to devote to grocery shopping/getting off campus. It\u2019s definitely a manageable thing, but it *is* nice to have.\n\n If it\u2019s something where the money saved by taking a 5 day really counts though, it\u2019s not hard to supplement. You can always live the broke college-student life on the weekends & keep a small stock of ramen, Mac n cheese bowls, or (if you\u2019re feeling *particularly* fancy) instant oatmeal. With the 5 day, you also get more dining dollars, so you can ration them a bit and strategically hit the SUB for CFA or panda or whatever else on the weekends. I haven\u2019t done the math, but I *thiiiiink* it should be somewhat viable. \n\nAlso protip: buy those mf [great value brand nutrigrain bars](https://www.walmart.com/ip/Great-Value-Fruit-Grain-Bars-Variety-Pack-41-6-oz-32-Count/764659276?wmlspartner=wlpa&selectedSellerId=0&wl13=259&adid=22222222278764659276_117755028669_12420145346&wmlspartner=wmtlabs&wl0=&wl1=g&wl2=m&wl3=501107745824&wl4=pla-293946777986&wl5=1026741&wl6=&wl7=&wl8=&wl9=pla&wl10=8175035&wl11=local&wl12=764659276&wl13=259&veh=sem_LIA&gclid=CjwKCAjw5NqVBhAjEiwAeCa97YShe-DSCZuWPecGEsg3-uxkeekApyptM8drm6lpoDKcZoePGcKt2BoC8UwQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds) if you ever hit up Walmart. You can get like, 32 or something stupid for 5$ which is pretty solid for a kid needing snacks on a budget. \n\n\nAnd a last casual tip: regardless of Mealplan, swipe that shit like it\u2019s candy. Midday break between classes, and need to do some work? Hit Memo for free coffee/drinks/cookies, snag a table & plug in ur laptop. Memo\u2019s music is always pretty solid too, so not bad vibes.",

Among other things, we're looking at average per-student credit earn rates on a daily basis, and we'll be making constant adjustments to ensure that students have classes that are compelling, rewarding, and of course attainable via study.\nWe appreciate the candid feedback, and the passion the community has put forth around the current topics here on Campus, our forums and across numerous social media outlets.\nOur team will continue to make changes and monitor community feedback and update everyone as soon and as often as we can.\n_________\n\nHope that helps",

Also want to add that in college, at least at Baylor, you will see your peers doing big things and some might even be high achievers, just know that they are on their own path and you will also have moments where things will work out.

There\u2019s also the Mix Cafe and some other stores in the Campus Corner near Earle that you can walk to. Other than that, I never really went off campus. I definitely didn\u2019t cross the highway because I was too scared to lol. And I never went to the Exon gas station after 6:00 because it got a bit sketchy. \n\nI managed to survive a year without a car but it was pretty hard. Would 100% recommend to get a car but if you can\u2019t, I still had tons of fun with my friends who did have cars. It\u2019s tolerable to live without a car, but I would say it\u2019s tolerable for a year max. After that, you will be wishing you have a car. \n\nAlso, I\u2019ve heard Ubers are dangerous when alone, but if you\u2019re with people, I think it\u2019s fine. I took an Uber before, but only with a friend and we went to the Farmers Market and some coffee shops/lunch places. If you\u2019re alone, don\u2019t even consider taking an Uber. But if you and another friend without a car want to explore Waco a bit, that\u2019s not the worst option. I was always fine in an Uber if my friend was with me and we had fun exploring Waco.",

To be frank- the safest part of Waco is Baylor campus, period. If you\u2019re heading more than, say, 2 blocks from campus streets, the standard of what your typical suburban mom would consider safe, but if you grew up outside of the suburbs anyways it\u2019s probably just a Tuesday afternoon.\n\nTo frame this: there was aggravated criminal activity <5 blocks from campus during this past school year. I don\u2019t mean to scare you though, genuinely, because that was an isolated event that I cherry-picked to highlight the extent of the bad. That happened once, and I don\u2019t think I received another baylor-alert notice for the rest of the year. Waco *can* be sketchy, but not if you use your head.\n\nIf you\u2019re going somewhere in the daylight, walking isn\u2019t the worst thing in the world- it\u2019s just not great; You just need to be 100%, **conciously** aware of the fact that drivers *will* make mistakes, and *will already be distracted* by the fact that the construction is unpredictable. No one but Waco locals will know what\u2019s going on with construction at any given moment, so while people *normally* are pretty okay at stopping at stop signs and paying attention, it\u2019s entirely possible something will change overnight and make things hazardous- and that happens *often*.\n\nIdeally though, you would Uber into downtown and walk around from there. Central downtown is pretty okay, though the fringes tend to percolate up homeless folk and\u2026 other *interesting* characters.\n\nTL;DR if you make an effort to keep your head on your shoulders and stick to daylight hours, you\u2019ll probably be okay traipsing around the Baylor Bubble. Uber to a central area if you\u2019re really concerned though.",

I think this summer Collins is getting renovated, but that doesn't matter for you. Honestly, most of your first two semesters will be gut courses and like maybe a few major-specific entry courses. Your possible religion courses may be anywhere around the campus, and the later courses for that will be in Tidwell. Also, Baylor is a small campus. You'll be surprised by how fast it takes to get from one place to the next. I lived in Allen, so I was far away from almost all of my classes. As of now, I'd pick your dorm based on the community it offers and if it's nice. University and Heritage are nice, Penland's aight but they have the strongest community on campus. Other nice halls include Brooks Flats, and Brooks Residential College.  You could also pick based on when you get to see which buildings your classes are in but I think that is much later. NORO, SORO, Martin, and Penland were all renovated so they are okay but their selling point is their community- it's really strong. All dorms mentioned have a good community so you can't go wrong with that, just others have different or stronger communities.",

Some girls are absolutely disgusting, not flushing, leaving toilet paper/feminine products .... There were bugs in our bathroom too. I had to bring disinfectant wipes with me every time I went to the bathroom and wipe everything down before I used it. There might have been mold too. Still, I managed. it\u2019s not impossible and if it\u2019s your only option, then I think you can manage too (Kokernot is better than Collins btw).The showers were pretty nice though, they had hot water all day. \nWould also recommend getting a loud fan if you don\u2019t like noise, the rooms have bad insulation. I think all of the dorms on campus do. \n\nThere were two things that made me stay in Kokernot and not transfer out after the fall semester. The first was a good roommate. We weren\u2019t the best of friends but she respected the time I wanted to go to bed and was very nice to me. The second was that my room was comfortable and cozy. It\u2019s a small room, but if you get a nice mattress pad, a few blankets, and a fuzzy carpet, it will feel like a nice, cozy home. If you raise your bed all the way you can make a nice little lounge area underneath your bed (I had a small beanbag, pillows, snacks, and a fluffy carpet). Those were the reasons why I stayed. It was very very very comfortable. \n\nI think every dorm has its drawbacks and benefits so just know whatever choice you have, it\u2019s gonna have pros and cons. I only could choose Kokernot or Collins, so that\u2019s why I ended up there. However, I was able to get through it! If you are living in Kokernot, you definitely can too.

Just showing up means a lot to the CL\u2014even if you only go for like 5 minutes. Participating in LLC events is not mandatory. It\u2019s the residence hall\u2019s attempt to try and connect with everyone. They do take the time and effort to put on those events. So I suggest you go to at least one. It\u2019s worth giving it a shot.\n\nEdit: your CLs will likely also host small events as well. I brought a water boiler to my desk duty and brought a bunch of hot cocoa. Wasn\u2019t an official event but ended up being the best event of my time as a CL. Residents came and went and a lot even came downstairs solely to get some hot chocolate.

        "body": "Okay, you can go two routes for getting a \u201cbusiness\u201d degree at Baylor: getting a B.S./B.A. or BBA (these are the business majors everyone knows). \n\nB.S./B.A are degrees in economics, management etc that specialize in those topics but have very little requirements for general business courses (like accounting, MIS, HR, etc) \n\nBBA is a Bachelor in Business Administration aka all the basics you need to know to run a business, regardless of your major. It includes two years of core business classes (in which the student is called a pre-business major) such as financial accounting, managerial accounting, introduction to business, introduction to microeconomics, beginner MIS, etc. After two years the student declares a major (any of the majors you listed), and takes classes according to the path the student chooses. There are still some upper-level classes that are mandatory for all business majors but upperclassmen have mostly their major classes. \n\n\nBBA is very popular because it gives you all-around knowledge of the business world (accounting, marketing, management, etc) and real-life skills (like negotiating, making a resume, etc) beyond your major classes. It\u2019s also extremely popular to double-major since the core classes are  the same for all business majors, making the workload manageable. \n\nPersonally beyond just the knowledge learned in school, the most important thing I took from Baylor was networking, whether that was with my classmates, career fairs, or just outside the school, networking is the single most valuable skill I learned at Baylor. It also makes it easier to network with other professionals (whether they went to Baylor or not) just by having a Baylor degree. \n\nI hope this helped.",

I\u2019ve learned a ton and we have 100% job placement. \n\nStereotypically, accounting and finance are the \u201creal\u201d majors in the business school. The others you\u2019ll have a hard time finding a job, especially a well-paying one with opportunity for growth. Traditional finance track is to go into banking, which I have no interest in. Traditional track for accounting is to go into audit or corporate tax. Both can be interesting and fulfilling, and open you up to a ton of opportunity later. It\u2019s not as boring as you expect, there\u2019s lots of gray area and cool niche things like forensic accounting or mergers and acquisitions.\n\nManagement Information Systems is also an option. We joke \u201cit\u2019s computer science for kids with social skills,\u201d which is somewhat accurate. Job placement is slightly lower, but starting salary will be fairly higher. You stand a higher risk of getting siloed into tech support kind of stuff though. \n\nI used to think management was a joke. How can you teach someone to manage people? Turns out it\u2019s one of the coolest majors we have. I believe \u201coperations\u201d would be a better name. You learn about supply chains and stuff, which can be super interesting. \n\nI\u2019d avoid marketing unless it\u2019s a secondary major. Job placement is minimal. \n\nBusiness fellows are more of an honors society than a major. They\u2019re kind of the nerdy weird kids, but some people like it. They get to register first, which is a huge help. Imagine never having a crappy Professor. \n\nPro Sales is a crazy good program if you want to do sales. Just keep in mind, most people leave sales after a few years. It\u2019s high pressure, and it can become miserable quick. \n\nOur Econ department is pretty weak here. \n\nIn general, I\u2019d advise that they knock out as many classes as they can before they get here. AP Economics is an absolute lifesaver because it saves you from taking 6 hours from just one class in high school (most ap classes only count for 3). Have them take generals at their local community college in the summers. Things like English and history. They\u2019re easier, cheaper, and don\u2019t count toward your gpa (you just need to pass them). This frees up hours to do double major, which I highly recommend.\n\nThe school works where for the first two years you take general classes, then you pick a major and take classes in that major while you finish up generals. By generals I mean one marketing class, two accounting classes, one finance class, etc\u2026. If you can get all of those in in the first two years, you\u2019ll have tried everything before you decide on a major. That helps you make a more informed decision about what you want to do. For example, I probably would have doubled in supply chain and MIS if I had taken management before I declared accounting. \n\nJust my thoughts. Sorry that was a little scattered, I\u2019m typing on a phone in bed. Feel free to dm me with other questions. I can also call if they want to talk to someone in person. Best of luck to them!",

This means you can declare your business major earlier. The flexibility of finishing your pre-business classes allows for double or triple major, early graduation, or a double major outside of the Business school.

After they\u2019re done with those foundational courses, they\u2019ll join the crew for the technical discipline they\u2019re most interested in. To keep more talented or skilled students on-hand more, each of the three workshops will hire some students as work-studies, who work 3~4 crew sessions per week. There are always one or two work-study spots per shop that open up every year, so a promising student with a particular crew (scenic/costume/lighting) will usually apply after a semester or two of doing crew time for credit and picking up the skills.\n\nEach of the three shops has one or two positions that make a little more and are for a more particular skill than general carpentry, stitching/draping, or electrics work; those positions are generally ones occupied by people with fairly advanced skill and some professional experience. The costume shop has one work-study who focuses on makeup, and that job was their higher-pay role back when I was there (through 2017); the contact for that would be [Erin](https://www.baylor.edu/theatre/index.php?id=954065), the costume shop manager. I don\u2019t know Erin personally, but my fiancee worked for her as an undergrad, and has nothing but rave reviews about Erin\u2019s professionalism.\n\nFair warning: they required taking the corresponding \u201celements\u201d class before taking any work-study position with the department, just so they were comfortable with your foundations, so they\u2019ll probably want your daughter to take the Makeup Elements class before potentially hiring her. This may be a good time to take a shot at it, though, since the longtime professor of makeup design and practice just retired about two weeks ago, and the new supervisor/professor will probably want to shake things up and do things their way. \n\nWorking for the Theatre department is great, it\u2019s operationally diverged from most departments at Baylor in that it does double duty as a teaching department and essentially a professional LORT theatre serving the cen-Tex region, but where the staff designers do 60~70% of their time as teaching faculty and 30~40% as professional designers (they\u2019re also all required to remain professionally active, so they stay active in DFW/Austin).",

        "body": "Gonna jump in to respond to the \"why would you even go to Baylor if you're gay\" and \"just go someplace else\" stuff. \n\nThe idea that people should just go someplace else if they're LGBT is extremely unrealistic. Although technically adults, undergrads often don't have a choice in the school they go to. Parents will stipulate they'll only pay if their child attends X university, for instance, or they're only offered scholarships at one place and it dictates where they go. Some of them do choose to go to Baylor, often because they take their faith very seriously and wouldn't be accepted at more secular institutions for their Christianity (I don't want to get into it but it can be really hard to be Christian in LGBT circles for instance, so someone might think Baylor is a good option for their faith without realizing it's not so good for their sexuality or gender identity). For whatever reason, LGBT folks end up at Baylor, and either can't go somewhere else or would experience a lot of hardship if they did. There just isn't the freedom of movement people imagine. \n\nWhat do we do then? Kick them out, enforce homogeneity in our ideology? (Lol). Bully them? These are ridiculously un-Christian options, despite the number of so-called Christians who endorse them. Amongst trans folks in particular, 41% have attempted suicide and about 80% have seriously considered it. Pair that with the immense amounts of outside violence that they and other LGBT folks have to deal with, and you're talking about one of the most at-risk communities in the United States. And Christians participate in that violence when they don't offer adequate support or when they fail to defend LGBT people when they are threatened (as is the case in the current [class action lawsuit](https://wacotrib.com/news/local/education/baylor-students-join-lgbtq-class-action-suit-against-department-of-education/article_b445d2f8-91b1-11eb-837c-6fe62cd647b5.html) against Baylor). Simply put, failing to stand up for these students or to provide them with community is a really great way to put them in serious danger or at least turn them against Christianity for the rest of their lives. At the very least, it's just bad evangelism. \n\nA chartered LGBT student group at Baylor shouldn't be seen as a threat to the Christian foundations of the school. A far bigger threat is damaging ourselves, our community, and students by telling them they're unwanted or not \"good enough\" to be Christian. Refusing them support in an environment that, again, has shown itself to be openly hostile is just cruel. \n\nOh, and if you wanna talk removing the beam from your own eye before you point out the speck in someone else's (Matthew 7:5), Baylor has continued to uphold and protect frat culture despite the NUMEROUS rape and sexual assault cases that have resulted from it. It's baffling that such a Christian university permits and even protects a culture based in heavy drinking, hazing, drugs, and rape. My sister's *loosely Catholic* university does better than Baylor, banning *all* fraternities and sororities. It's hypocritical to think Baylor is a perfectly wonderful Christian school during all the rape trials, and then to call it un-Christian and bowing to mainstream culture when they allow gay students to meet on campus.",

Would that priest be bigoted for refusing to do so, or is the bigot the one with the expectation and insistence that the priest adopt a stance that is so clearly contrary to his own faith? \n\n\nThis is where we are at with Baylor and LGBTQ+. Baylor, if it is to be a Christian institution must support itself on the twin pillars of faith and education. For Church, For Texas. This is Baylor\u2019s identity. It is the sole thing that sets this University apart from other expensive secular private schools with less than Ivy League academics (see TCU and SMU.) All are welcome into a compassionate and tolerant community. All are encouraged to engage with one another and pursue the highest goals and aspirations of their fields. I think we are all united in Baylor\u2019s support and furtherance of education. But the University would not exist without that second of pillar of Faith. The culture at Baylor is not possible without that second pillar. The insistence that we must erode the pillar of faith, by adopting stances that are contrary to the institutions purposes and missions, will crack and crater the University given time. At which point, Baylor is not Baylor. It\u2019s just a really expensive \u201cWaco University.\u201d",

You can be gay and go to Baylor, I had plenty of friends at Baylor who were gay and they were happy as clams, that doesn't mean Baylor needs to officially sanction LGBTQ+ groups so they look accepting. Baylor also doesn't need to officially sanction alcohol consumption, extra-marital sex, idolatry, or any other number of things Baptists believe are immoral. FWIW, I don't share in Baylor's belief's that homosexuality is a sin and I don't share many other of Baylor's beliefs - I do believe Baylor should continue to hold true to its mission and not give in to wokeism.",

For example, God tells them that briars and thistles will sting them (Gen. 3:17), causing physical pain. The logical extension of that is the realization of sicknesses, disease, etc. The natural world has been tainted because of our sin. We live in a fallen, imperfect world.\n\nWe have free will, but I think the tenets of Molinism are pretty sound. God knows what we're going to do, but we have the free will to make those decisions on our own. For example, my daughter, when she lived in Collins, told me that there were some orphaned raccoons behind the building. Because I know her so well, I knew she would try to nurse them to health and rescue them. With her own free will, she organized students who went to the administration so they wouldn't euthanize the raccoons. Free will and God's providence are not at odds with one another.\n\nThis is why climate change is such an important topic to me. Our free will to pollute the earth is doing damage to an already fallen world. In Genesis 2:15, God tells Adam to care for and tend to the earth. Oops.",

Defenses *really* had to respect the passing game, which made the excellent OLine and RB play even better. The one downside was that the playbook (at the time) was fairly heavy on options that defenses knew would be handoffs since Shapen is much smaller than Gerry and we were already on the back-up QB.\n\nWith a playbook designed around Shapen's strengths?

Barely said a word, only thing he said was \u201cVenmo\u201d when we told him we didn\u2019t have cash. Made a post on r/aggies today and many people have experienced the same thing. I also found some older Reddit posts with identical encounters under r/ufl and r/unt. Most people that commented on my post just dismissed it as just another scam, but this is extremely suspicious to me. The fact that multiple different universities are experiencing these identical encounters simultaneously suggests some level of organization. I just don\u2019t see individual hustlers replicating the exact same scam, especially on this scale.",

Each chapter takes at least 3 hours of reading/notes and to have an A you might need to do even more than that.\n\nOne suggestion would be to get the Campbell bio book and start early. Then you will just be relearning later. Bio I promise will be your hardest class first semester.\n\nAlso if you\u2019re taking psychology be warned that it\u2019s not as easy as other colleges.

I ended up picking baylor because it was a lot smaller, and (from what I\u2019ve heard) class sizes are also a lot smaller. I personally learn better that way. From the premed students I\u2019ve spoken to from both schools, UT students say the premed experience is more \u201cindividual\u201d and the baylor pre med experience is more \u201ctogether\u201d u just have to figure out what environment will work best for you regardless of stats and ranks (at least that\u2019s what I did) i have a sibling at UT majoring in comp sci and he also agrees that his experience is very independent aside from office hours. \n\ntuition difference:\nfor me personally, the tuition for both UT and Baylor is around the same bc of scholarships and aid. I\u2019d say go where you will pay the least. both schools are amazing for pre med! if money is not an issue, I\u2019d say really look into what environment u find yourself growing in. small community or large community? again, both schools have wonderful communities. your college experience really depends on what you make of it in my opinion:)\n\ngetting into Baylor pre med: \nI\u2019m not sure if you took the SAT, but the website (link below) says if you have a 1180 with greater than a 570 on the math section (or ACT 24 with 24 on math) you qualify. if you did not take the SAT, you were holistically reviewed. the website also says \u201cIf a student is admitted to Baylor, but does not qualify for the Pre Med/Pre Dent designation, they may retest and submit new scores to Undergraduate Admissions. Updated scores must be received and processed by August 1.\u201d Other than test scores, there is also a course requirement to be officially designated. \u201cCurrent students may receive the premedical or predental designation once they have received credit for PHP 1105 (Foundations of Medicine) OR PHP 1206 (Introduction to Health Professions) and meet one of the following requirements:\n\nEarn a 3.0 cumulative GPA or better after 30 credit hours at Baylor University\nEarn a 3.0 cumulative GPA or better in 12 or more credit hours of biology, chemistry, physics, and math/statistics classes at Baylor University\u201d\n\nnot sure if this was any help, definitely talk to your admissions counselor though! good luck :) \n\nwebsite: https://www.baylor.edu/prehealth/index.php?id=930453",

That being said, every dorm definitely does have groups of people that stick to their building. I made all of my friends outside of my dorm and they are also all in different forms. It just depends on what you want to do. I lived in a first year dorm and I think it\u2019s much better than specific community dorms. This way you branch out more and have friends outside of your own major.",

Yes it\u2019s incredibly difficult (but CS is gonna be difficult at any school), but basically all of of the CS professors are the best of the best(I\u2019ve only had 1 bad experience so far). I had literally 0 programming experience before coming to Baylor and was able to get an internship at a FAANG company this summer and 100% owe it all to the professors. From my experience they have all been very kind, responsive, and helpful. I personally think the main reason people drop or switch majors is because they didn\u2019t go to office hours as much as they should have and/or didn\u2019t want to study as hard as they needed too(not trying to be negative, some classes I would study 12hrs a day 7days a week for so, sometimes it\u2019s just a grind). \n\nIf you want to make life easier while your here: \n- Math: I would either take courses at MCC over the summer or use bubooks and just try to get a really good professor during fall/spring. Also, I personally HATED linear algebra and regret taking it over calc 3, but that also could just be me (plus I\u2019m terrible at math). \n\n- Science: rocks for jocks and then chemistry is supposed to be pretty easy. \n\n- CS: Your basically not going to have any options for specific professors teaching a class as it\u2019s usually the same professors teaching the same classes every semester. This may sound \u201cbad\u201d but IMO it\u2019s better because they have more experience teaching that subject and as a result teach it better than anyone else. \n\n- Intro 1 & 2 are crucially important as they will make all future classes so much easier if you really focus on them. \n\n- Data structures and Algorithms are the most important classes when it comes to interviews specifically Data Structures (be a sponge in Dr. Hamerlys class as the man is a genius). \n\n- The career center is awesome! I think the last time I spoke with them they told me there was like a 99% job placement before graduation and 100% after. Plus the career fair kind of blew my mind and they usually have some really cool companies that visit throughout the semesters (just this semester I recall Tesla and SpaceX). \n\n- I wouldn\u2019t take data structures and intro to comp systems at the same time as they are both super difficult and basically impossible to manage. \n\n- For any other suggestions I would honestly just talk with upperclassman.\n\nLastly, and probably the most important part of the college experience is being able to network. Find successful people and try to mimic their success or at least learn what they did to become successful. \n\nCongrats by the way, I hope you found what you were looking for and wish you luck on your journey and future studies.",

When I was there (which, to be fair, was 4 years ago by now), the curriculum felt a bit behind the times (we had to do full classes on Java and using Java to make GUIs, but never learned anything about modern web apps until being thrown into one poorly-instructed Software Engineering II project) and the majority of the professors were... underwhelming (I think I had more classes that I would consider horribly taught than I did that I would consider well taught). It was definitely not on the level of Baylor's hard sciences or business school, both of which are extremely cutting edge and competitive programs with more amazing professors than you'd be able to take in two college lifetimes.\n\nBut I believe they've invested a lot in the College of Engineering and Computer Science since then in efforts to bring it up to speed, so things may be better now.\n\nIn any case, CS is the kind of thing where if you're a smart kid with a talent for the field you'll figure it out just fine. How good your professors and classes are isn't actually that important for your post-college outcomes. You can find good lectures and resources on YouTube and Google, and you'll always have to do that anyway no matter how good your classes themselves are. What matters is having good networking/recruiting opportunities for jobs, talented peers to work with and hang out with, and a social/living environment where you can be happy and enjoy life enough to actually be productive. Baylor has all of those in spades, so you can and will be extremely successful out of Baylor CS despite the drawbacks I mentioned.\n\nMy personal experience of feeling behind is also largely attributable to splitting my time (as a bioinformatics major) 50/50 between CS and hard sciences and not being able to focus fully on CS until my senior year, so don't let me scare you off from that alone. Those who don't do that are able to spend a lot more time and energy on outside-of-class CS learning and practical experience/side projects, which are where you really make your gains as a CS student. I got into an elite grad school and now good jobs just fine even despite all that.\n\nIf you do commit to Baylor for CS, I'd 100% recommend living in the Teal Residential College. Getting to be fully immersed in a social environment with dozens of students in the same classes/tracks as you is incredible for both networking and studying. You also get a quieter environment with lots of study spaces instead of the absolute chaos (and more cramped quarters) of a standard dorm building.",

In this case, athletes are not being awarded for doing the bare minimum. They are being awarded for reaching certain academic milestones and metrics. We don\u2019t know yet what they are, but based on other systems at other schools, it seems like it will require something more than the minimum.\n\nAs for student subsidy of athletics, it is incorrect to say that \u201cnone of your tuition\u201d goes to athletics. If you pay an athletics fee, which almost every student does, that goes towards athletics. There may even be other hidden fees that goes towards that purpose. All but a select few athletic departments receives student subsidies for athletics, so Baylor is not unique in this circumstance. The exceptions are schools like Ohio State, Texas, Oklahoma, and others. This amount of subsidy tends to be higher and more prominent amongst public universities in lower tier conferences, but this is not the rule necessarily. Baylor\u2019s levels as a private school in the Big 12 are likely comparable or better than average when compared to other peers in the P5. However, this is an important topic as it gets to the growing question of the place of athletics in institutions intended for learning and research. NIL, realignment, growing tuition costs, reduced sports interests, are all driving a change and a gap that could someday break and we could find ourselves in a world without college athletics or some drastically different structure.",

If you think you won't stay in the U.S then Baylor will carry more of a name brand internationally going forward, now that they've achieved R1 status. For better or worse peoples undergrads on an international scale get their 'prestige' from the grad schools research. That is why UT-Austin is more widely known than Rice internationally. \n\nIf you think you'd want to stay in Dallas than I think SMU would give you the better network without a doubt. In other parts of Texas it would be fairly equal. In other parts of the country Baylor might be more known but that really only matters at top 20 schools.\n\nI'm sure you could find your crowd at both schools and while I cant directly speak on SMU if you're a fairly social person you'd have no trouble making friends at Baylor.

That's why the US News gold standard gets under a lot of scrutiny. You are choosing between Baylor and SMU, not Baylor and Harvard. If anything Baylor is trending to pass up SMU in those rankings more than anything. \n\nHowever, if you're dead set on working in Dallas, SMU would make it easier getting initial interviews since the city is familiar with SMU grads. Long term though, your work is what'll matter more than where you got your degree. With that said, plenty of companies recruit out of Baylor, and truthfully, those companies seem to be growing at the career fair every yr. To give you an idea, I was able to get an internship with JP Morgan last summer and now got one lined up with Goldman Sachs NY office this summer. Plenty of other students here find such opportunities. In the end your resume matter more than whether you went to school at Baylor or SMU, the Dallas preference is more for when an SMU Alumni stumbles upon your resume and gives you a more detailed look just because of your connection to them. \n\nIn the end choose what feel right to you tho.",

I\u2019m a graduate of the aviation program and current airline pilot, I loved the program and friends I made at Baylor.  Unfortunately, I can\u2019t speak to how hard it is to get in, it is different now than how it was when I went through.  What I can say is that it\u2019s a great program; I learned a lot and it definitely helped prepare me for the world of professional aviation.  Aviation is expensive, as is Baylor so be prepared for a higher cost than just Baylor tuition. However, it was definitely worth it in my mind.  I love what I do and make a great living traveling the world. Every year the Baylor aviation department has a banquet and I bid my schedule to go to it, so I try my best to stay involved with the program.  One of my favorite things about aviation is how small it\u2019s world really is.  One year at one of these banquets I met a Baylor aviation grad who was serving as the guest speaker, I was just a flight instructor at the time. Fast forward a few years and he\u2019s my captain across the ocean, I\u2019ve flown with him a few times now and actually texted him earlier today.\n\nFlight school takes its own time and studying to obtain all your certificates and ratings.  You\u2019ll end up having to do cross country flights, both solo and dual, on the weekends and at night.  It\u2019s not a typical 8-5 type of class schedule. \n\nI\u2019m happy to help answer any other questions you may have.",

Are you down to take summer classes? I just switched to pre-nursing and have talked with the pre-nursing advisor and coordinator of pre-nursing student services recently so I can definitely try to guide you with a little bit more detail. \n\nTo summarize, however, people usually try to get chemistry and microbiology out of the way in their first year (since they are the easiest out of the four sciences). Some capable people can juggle their workload pretty well this early in the game and might also opt to do microbiology and A&P I together. Keep in mind, however, that A&P I and II are the hardest of the four sciences (and taught by only one professor who teaches both A&P) according to many students so be careful. Likewise, even if it says that you can complete either one in any order, I would not recommend that route\u2014especially at Baylor. Please complete A&P I & II in a chronological manner. \n\nLastly, I would suggest that you look up Baylor's latest book catalog (probably their 2021-2022 for recency matters), which shows you a sample curriculum plan. You can also google \"Baylor University Pre-Nursing Degree Plan.\" This is probably one of the best ways to plan out your four years if you cannot access an advisor just yet.\n\nSimilarly, you can transfer 15 credit hours from CC once you have started attending Baylor. Plan accordingly in the summer and keep in contact with both the pre-nursing advisor and coordinator of the pre-nursing student services. Good luck!",

        "body": "Going a semester early simply means trying to get your prereqs done before the traditional application timeline. Nursing school application is done on a semester basis. Basically, if you're trying to graduate early by a semester, you would try to apply by July (at the end of your freshman year and before the start of your sophomore year). That way, you can go to the nursing school spring of your sophomore year instead of the traditional fall of your junior year. To accomplish this task, you need to take summer classes and Baylor have a restriction on said summer classes (depending on the type you're taking).\n\nNow, there are two types of summer classes: 1) Baylor University summer classes and 2) CC (community college) summer classes. If you do your summer classes at Baylor, there is no limit under the four-years that you are attending Baylor as it is considered an extension of you attending classes at Baylor. Basically, it is treated as if it was just a regular fall or spring semester at Baylor. You would need to research how much credits you can take depending on your classification (ie. freshman, sophomore, junior, senior). 12 credits per semester is required to be considered a full-time student. Some take up to 15 credits per semester (in case you fail a class like A&P but plan accordingly) and some go even higher. I think the maximum cap is 18 for most students but if need be, I heard students getting their cap override to accommodate 19-20 credits per semester (which is very risky move for the sake of your GPA since it's a lot of work).\n\nHowever, CC summer classes are different. You can only transfer 15 credits once you have started attending Baylor University. Most importantly: you need to check the ETC (equivalent course tool). Search up the name of the community college that you wish to attend and see if the course lines up with the course that you need credit for at Baylor. If not, do not attend that community college. Likewise, most CC classes are for 1000-2000 level classes. Higher levels (3000-4000) cannot be done outside of Baylor. If I were to take CC summer classes, I'd recommend taking them at MCC (McLennan Community College) or at another community college near your home (if you wish to go home that summer but still take CC classes). It is more affordable than Baylor's Summer Classes. If you need to take Baylor's Summer Classes, I would only do so if you have used up all 15 credits allowed for transfer from CC or if it's a higher-level class. That's why it's important to double-check these courses because: 1) some of the higher-level courses might not be offered during the summer at Baylor and 2) if you have a hard class that can be taken at CC (like A&P), do not waste your limited 15 transfer credit on an easy class. If you're another major, I feel like that would've been fine (like taking religion classes, American literature and such at CC) but personally, having saved up my 15 transfer credits for this summer for my remaining nursing classes, I'm glad I never wasted it on those easy classes bc my nursing prereq GPA requires them haha.\n\nAlso, keep in mind: you need a science GPA of 2.75 and above (for the four sciences) and a cumulative nursing pre-req GPA of 3.00 or above to be admitted. Plus, you need to take HESI (but I heard it's relatively okay). \n\nWith that, DM me if you need anymore help. This reddit response is becoming a little too long for my liking haha.",

        "body": "Adding onto this as a transfer from Blinn (feeder community college for tamu) to Baylor. \n\nTAMU is definitely a great choice if you care about the culture and general college experience. It is super fun if you get into going to football games and participating in the traditions. The people are nice, and it\u2019s easier to find friends imo because of the amount of people and clubs on campus. \n\nBaylor is great too, but i\u2019ve found it hard to make friends here although that might be because I transferred during covid. The traditions aren\u2019t as good as TAMU because there aren\u2019t many people to participate, and most are more interested in greek life events than campus events. It\u2019s definitely not the same community as TAMU. The college experience from my personal pov is that of a very nice community college. BU has the benefit of smaller classes which gives you a better opportunity to make connections with classmates and professors. Within the business school, you are rigorously trained on professional skills and tactics to be chosen out of a sea of applicants for internships and jobs. I can\u2019t speak to the TAMU side of this since obviously i ended up at baylor lmao. \n\nLocation wise: waco sucks. There isn\u2019t much to do here. College station is a really cool city for college students considering northgate and just fun activities around town. Waco has a few things, and a lot more coffee shops if that\u2019s your thing. Waco can also be dangerous if you end up in the wrong spot at the wrong time, but i haven\u2019t had much experience with that since i\u2019m in a gated community. \n\nThat being said, if any of what i said doesn\u2019t matter to you, then it definitely boils down to cost. Baylor is EXPENSIVE. but the curriculum and training that you get from the business school is amazing. TAMU is also well respected and they have the added benefit of the aggie network.

Our kiddo is at Texas Tech now and that held for her when she lived on campus as well.\n\nWhen I was there in the early 90s, doing the 2 meals-a-day plan + one on Saturday (cafeterias were closed on Sunday, IIRC) was more than enough. My roommate had a grilled cheese sandwich maker and we kept sandwich supplies around to supplement. It was a bit cheaper that way.\n\nBut if you\u2019re on full scholarship or have no issues with finances, I suppose you could just go big or go home!",

It\u2019s almost $1,000 more to add two days to your meal plan\u2026 not worth it at all!! \n\n- You only get $150 dining dollars with the 7-day plan, but you get $200 dining dollars with the 5-day plan. \n\n- If you\u2019re going to be an upperclassman, depending on your finances/scholarships, I recommend sticking with the 5 day unlimited plan.

Once on campus most athletic media swag is pretty easy to find and the athletic department buildings itself is where you can readily find posters for the more obscure sports. \n\nIf you're still having trouble finding what you were looking for, or easily need to get a couple dozen or more for distribution at a social event (official or not), the fan engagement department is a great resource.",

One of my best friends decided to major in journalism and minor in business, and a few history majors also did the same thing. The Career Center is also really helpful with this\n\nThat being said, I\u2019m always here to try and recruit more history majors lol",

Advice I wish I knew way back then.\n\n\u201811 Baylor grad and still paying student loans today (and foreseeable future). I wouldn\u2019t change my undergrad experience for anything but I will say to take time to consider alternative options, i.e., other schools. Or apply for every scholarship under the sun to help offset what you would take on in student loans. \n\nWhat\u2019s your major and can you go to other Texas schools (if you\u2019re a Texas resident) that offer a competitive degree in that field? I didn\u2019t fully know it then but I struggled with morale & mental issues knowing how much I was making vs. how much was coming out of each of my paychecks to pay for life in general. It\u2019s still a sensitive subject to this day but I\u2019m in a much better spot financially than I was coming out of college.\n\nAnother thing I learned is that most real world jobs don\u2019t require specific degrees. I have known colleagues who went to lesser known schools and were in my industry at the same level, if not higher up the corporate ladder. And they had random degrees. It\u2019s the age old adage: it\u2019s not what you know but who you know. \n\nYour college experience will be whatever YOU make it. If you\u2019re really keen on going to Baylor, call the financial office and ask for scholarship opportunities and work with guidance counselor in finding more as well. Seriously you have no idea how big of a financial commitment you\u2019re making when you\u2019re young and it can have huge ramifications downstream. Be smart about this, OP. You got this.",

Still would not recommend unless you're at a truly elite school and can be confident you'll be competitive for the best of the best jobs after graduation.\n\nThe rule of thumb I often tell people is: don't take out more total debt than you will earn in annual salary with 2-3 years of graduation. Note that you also have to take into account potential grad school required for your chosen career path. Most importantly, *if you do not know these numbers pretty confidently, do not take out any hefty debt at all*.\n\n$50k of total debt is cheap and easy for an engineering major who will start at $60-70k immediately after undergrad with likely no grad school in their future. That same $50k will be difficult for a social work major who needs a Master's in order to do much and even then will struggle to make $50k until mid-career.\n\nNote that the numbers I cite are for loans/debt. If your parents can help with, say, $10k/year, that puts you at around $70k of loans which is doable if you're in a high-earning field and are confident you're really good at it.",

It is a very common phenomenon for southerners to develop horrible seasonal depression at popular northern schools like Michigan and Cornell (which have *beautiful* summers) because of the climate.",

Even if it's not a big problem, paying less always beats paying more. I have no idea how appealing works, but unless there's a risk they decide to make you pay more then there's probably not much downside in trying to see if you can stretch a little more financial aid out of the school.",

The cybersecurity concentration basically has you use the CS electives towards cybersecurity classes and they add like two 1-credit labs and swap a computer architect course with a cryptology course. Both would get you job ready but the cybersecurity would tailor your experience towards cybersecurity as your elective courses are in that field. If you're interested in cybersecurity there is a team on campus and they have competed so that can be added experience to make you more desirable to employers.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI guess the question is if you'd rather get a job in cybersecurity or some other field such as software engineering?",

Congrats on your acceptance!\n\n[Here](https://www.ecs.baylor.edu/index.php?id=962953) are the degree flowcharts for the different concentrations offered in ECS. You\u2019ll notice that CyberSec and regular CompSci start with pretty much the same courses, so if you wanted to switch into or out of the concentration, it wouldn\u2019t be a big deal.\n\nThe function of the CyberSec is that it locks in the elective computer science classes that you would be taking. You\u2019ll still end up with the exact same BSCS degree, but you get to tell employers that you concentrated in Cybersecurity, which they LOVE.\n\nI will add that Baylor has a very active and nationally recognized Cybersecurity team that anyone is welcome to participate in. If you were unsure of whether or not you wanted to concentrate in cybersecurity, this would be a great place to start. Then you can make the decision after your first year of if you want to be in the concentration or not.\n\nOverall, you\u2019re still getting a degree in computer science, so you\u2019ll have a job lined up at the end if you make it out. I am certainly not some sort of cyber-genius and I\u2019m easily making 6 figures right out of college.\n\nLet me know if you have anymore questions!",

I am not super extroverted and was not interested in Greek life so I was very active during optional activities like Line Camp and Welcome Week.

The pre-health committee guides you through the whole process, starting with a list of which classes to take and when, advisors, and by the time you reach junior year, a premed mock interview leading to a strong composite letter of recommendation (made of impressions from your professors, your CV, your grades and good things from that mock interview) being sent along with your transcript to all the med schools you apply to.\n\nThe premed classes, including lectures and labs, are rigorous, I\u2019m not gonna lie about it. You will need to put some serious effort in order to maintain your GPA. You will have help from your professors (class sizes are small so you can get 1-on-1 help from professors after class or at office hours), from tutors who have gone through those classes before and from your fellow classmates.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend Baylor for anyone who is serious about becoming a physician and is willing to dedicate the next 4 years to spending a lot of time studying. Everyone I know who\u2019s met the requirements set by the pre-health committee and wanted to be doctors are now full-fledged attending physicians (MD or DO) in a variety of specialties.\n\nYou will have plenty of opportunities to socialize- intramurals, clubs, volunteering opportunities, concerts, games.\n\nIf you can, try to study abroad too. Another great thing about Baylor.\n\nI hope that answers your questions. PM me if you have more.",

I was In a similar boat (Baylor '21). \nCame in broke with no family $ to help. \n\nA few big things, and if I think of more I will add to this. \n\n1. Do either of your parents have a bachelor's degree? If not, look into the First in Line Success Academy (FILSA). This is a generous scholarship for first gen college students (and also a great program in general). \n*they also have extra money put away for students in need. I have even gotten extra scholarship money in semesters where I really needed it. \n\n2. FAFSA. You mentioned this in your comment, have you already gotten your reward? This was a huge help for me, as I got thousands every semester from this. \n\n3. Apply for an LLC. I know the LEAD LLC has a scholarship of a few thousand every semester that was a big help for me. It's also a scholarship you can maintain all 4 years even after moving to your own apartment. You just have to take leadership classes which honestly are pretty helpful. And Dr. Wood rocks!\n\n4. Consider being an RA (CL at Baylor). Of course this is not a guarantee but it's also not that hard to become one based off my experiences with friends. \n\nBaylor wants you to graduate. They know it's expensive and have money put away to help people in need so you don't transfer or drop out. \n\nI did not have an academic scholarship at all (bad student in hs) and I left with a very reasonable amount of debt comparable to what I would've had at a state school. Look into your options. And explore the scholarships Baylor has that are either need based, or given through working for it (like the LLC and CL position). \n\nHope this helps. Here to answer any questions you have. Sic em bears!",

Unless you're choosing Baylor to be around ultra-religious people or some specific aspect of education you can't get anywhere else... The cost is not worth it.\n\nIn hindsight, I should've just gone to A&M or Oklahoma or any other cheap fuckin school with a good reputation. Shit, A&M is like 1/3 the price, likely has scholarships as well, and their engineering schools are great too. Plus, their alumni base, as cultish as it is, will hire you simply for being an Aggie.

FAR bigger names, such as Michael Phelps get arrested once, then twice, for DUI and it didn\u2019t stay in the news more than a few days.\n\nI just am curious on how much of this news was always \u201cavailable\u201d, but right now is the \u201cright time\u201d to have its run through the news cycle.",

Germs are gonna be everywhere wheither we like it or not, and with the data released showing the covid vaxxed can spread it too, you dont know where you can get it from. Plus we still have yet to see data showing mandating masks has any impact on prevention of the disease being spread. Meaning either way, its inevitable that everyone will be exposed eventually.\n\nIm not against people being masked or vaxxed or saying they have to do class online for a time because they think they are vulerable. \n\nAnd if you mean being held legally liable for catching a disease in a private setting, I doubt a court would rule for such a shakey case to being with.\n\nBut I am against mandates. We all have our own bodily liberty and responsibility for our own health only. Even Docters and Nurses must wait for consent before giving treatement. I cannot help or always know another person's health. They must determine what to do about it themselves. Because wheither people as a whole are stupid or smart about their own health, at some point we'll have to live with it and accept the risk. Its the same way we accept the risk that every time we leave our rooms, we might get injured or die. We can try to minimize that risk as much as we can, but can never truly eliminate it. For the very few that are compromised, they can have exceptions to do things at home. But for the vast majority, we need to truly live with personal liberty, which entails pain suffering and risk. \n\nI know that this can seem a bit much, but mandating masks set a precedent for Authorities to determine health decisions. This can lead to lockdowns in our rooms like other universities did for weeks at a time, to 100% online classes (which severely degrade education quality for me and many other people), or for mandates for an endless series of vaccines to take with every variant as the goal posts get pushed for what is considered vaccinated (Single shot, doubel shot + 2 weeks, booster shot, quad vax, etc.) Though, I dont doubt your good intentions, I dont think this can lead to any good results from that.",

Baylor is a wonderful University and I think the transition can be a bit difficult at times but overall is not too big of an issue and I am so glad to have come down to Waco anyways. As the other guys have mentioned, Waco/Baylor is probably a bit more open about matters of faith than what we probably grew up around. Being Christian I actually really appreciate this, but I have heard this can be difficult for non-Christians. Though many non-Christians do come to Baylor and love the eperience.\n\nI think the best part of coming from up north, however, is that people are just much friendlier in Waco. People are intentional about forming friendships and genuinely want to care for you. Southern hospitality is no lie. Also, country dancing is a thing and I'm so glad I \"learned\" how to do that; I'm still not great. \n\nIf you have any other more specific questions, feel free to let me know!

Before I begin today's lecture, let me remind the reader that contacting the HelpDesk with the specifics of your location and BearID will result in faster response and resolution of issues with your network performance. \n\nThat aside, let us begin - and given that I am not directly involved in wireless operations, please take the ramblings of an old man with a grain (or bucket) of salt...\n\nYou're in the Baylor Science Building, so I'm making the assumption that you have a solid understanding of physics. You don't specify where in the BSB, so let's further assume you're in the atrium.\n\nAs a practical physics problem, providing consistent wifi coverage to all seats in the BSB atrium is a doozy. The access point (AP) is both receiver and transmitter. In the realm of EMF, that is subject to r^2 attenuation. That means that the distance from the client (you) to the AP is a factor. Imagine the concentric spheres of signal emanating from your laptop and how they overlap with signal coming back from the AP. You'll get better network performance by moving closer to the AP.\n\nFurthermore, wireless access is a shared medium, unlike wired ethernet, which is a dedicated medium. I can dive deeper into what that means, but for the sake of this monologue, the end result is like having a conversation in an elementary school cafeteria. The more kids are talking, the louder they talk, the more difficult it is for speaker and listener to understand each other. By analogy, as the density of population increases on a shared medium, the more difficult it is to sustain useful networking throughput. It's a physical limitation. It can be overcome by throwing lots and lots of APs into that dense space, but then you start working against other factors such as budget and esthetics.\n\nThank you for attending my Ted talk. Be sure to send the specifics of your location to the HelpDesk at helpdesk@baylor.edu next time you run into this situation. It's a numbers game, and reporting your issue to the HelpDesk is the best way we have to track the numbers. The more people that report in on a situation, the stronger our argument is for providing more APs in that space.",

Don\u2019t think a crypto specific fund will ever be launched as a class, but this could possibly be a club that\u2019s affiliated with Baylor. Just don\u2019t know how it would work because the student managed fund uses a portion of the university\u2019s endowment and they have to make withdrawals every year/semester for scholarships and with volatility in crypto I don\u2019t know if baylor would sign on to that. If you\u2019re interested I would talk to David Morehead; I believe he\u2019s the head guy for Baylor\u2019s endowment and helps run the student managed fund/class. Brandon Troegle also helps run the class and is certified in alternative investments (CAIA I believe).\n\nI\u2019m sure there would be some degree of interest in the student body, but this seems like something that would take a year or two to set up. Also don\u2019t know if alumni donations would specifically have to donate to something like this. \n\nThe student managed fund is also heavy on teaching students the fundamentals on how to analyze stocks/industries/market tailwinds. For example you have to make some fairly long presentations and put together ~15 page research paper on a stock. I\u2019m not huge into crypto, but what would be the comparable learning aspect for it? That\u2019s why I believe it will never be a class, but possibly some type of org. \n\nAlso to the other comment the fund isn\u2019t managed by fellows; anyone can apply. And I\u2019m about to start the Masters of Accounting program and don\u2019t think we\u2019ve ever talked about crypto; maybe spent 30 mins on the blockchain.",

Most problems on the network are generally resolved within 15 minutes of me seeing them, as they typically just involve some routine maintenance on the system or a more localized solution. Unfortunately, I need more precise information about your trouble and what you're seeing in order to do anything meaningful about it (information such as what location, what error, username, and a wireless MAC address if possible). \n\nWireless operations are, however, subject to environmental interference and client maintenance. If you're sitting in the middle of a crowd of people all trying to use wireless at the same time, you won't get as much bandwidth on the network as you would if you were alone. You also won't get very much bandwidth if you're in a strange location, at the edge of coverage, or your wireless drivers are out of date (generally if you have problems all over campus, it's because the wireless drivers are out of date or the adapter is on death's door). In any case, I'm happy to help folks get connected and address problems as they pop up. \n\nFor a little behind-the-scenes, Airbear as a network has over 2500 access points and a large fiber optic and routing distribution that serves as the backhaul to the internet. I am on Airbear myself at all hours of the day, so if something goes sideways, I'm generally on it before it even gets to the Help Desk. That said, I can't be everywhere at once, so I do rely on users to report issues they see in order to resolve them. I have tried to set up some automated maintenance, but it doesn't work as well as I'd hope. \n\nLet me know if you have any questions!",

In my work I am responsible for hiring engineers and architects and I honestly don't even look at the university they graduated from. The college on your resume is mainly a checkbox for the recruiter in the HR department. \n\nThere could be instances were you get a job placement due to another Baylor alumn, but would that be worth $120k+ in student loans? \n\nWhatever you decide I wish you luck, maybe my son gets lucky and finds other scholarship opportunities and is able to join you all.",

The admissions people may say it is optional but they\u2019re certainly not blind to a really good score, especially compared to someone who does poorly on it or doesn\u2019t have a score at all.\n\n- study as hard as you can and do as well as you can on AP exams. A passing score of 3 on some of these exams will get you a semester to a whole year of college credits at Baylor.\n\n- this upcoming summer, take as many required general classes at your community college. You will enjoy small group discussions, find out what interests you and you will probably come out with a 4.0 GPA with little effort.\n\nHere\u2019s a link for you to see which classes will be accepted for transfer:\n\nhttps://www8.baylor.edu/ect/search-by-outside-institution\n\n- if you still have general classes that you haven\u2019t taken with the above, stay in community college until you\u2019re done with them. Unlike high school, you can start college at any semester (Fall, Summer, Spring)\n\n- once you\u2019re done with all the basic freshman/early sophomore classes, transfer to Baylor. With your excellent GPA, you should get a decent scholarship. Also look for other scholarships offered by Baylor\u2019s alumni/donors and of course, outside scholarships.\n\n- if you\u2019re a dependent to your parents and you\u2019re close to the limit between poor and middle class or middle class and rich, make sure none of you makes too much money. After a certain threshold, you wouldn\u2019t qualify for some grant money.\n\n- once you get to Baylor, study hard, don\u2019t waste any time, keep your eyes on your goal, graduate in 3 years max.\n\n- stay on your parents\u2019 health insurance \n\n- don\u2019t buy a car and therefore, don\u2019t bother with car insurance. A bicycle is all you need. \n\n- live off-campus but not too far from campus, share rent and utilities with a roommate\n\nMy other suggestion, if you\u2019re a Texas resident, would be to apply to all the universities in Texas that you wouldn\u2019t mind attending and to go to the one that will offer you the most amount of money (tuition plus room and board).\nAfter all, who knows, you might want to save money to go to Baylor for graduate school.",

For example, taking 70-80k in loans is okay for an engineering or CS major, but if you were an education major you wouldn't want to take much more than 40-50k.\n\nEducation loans are an investment, like buying stocks or a house; if you're getting a positive ROI in the long run, it's worth it! And vice versa The trick is to do your research heavily on what amount is worth it for you *BEFORE* starting college. What gets people into trouble is going all-in on their dream school, taking all the loans necessary to go there, and then figuring out their career later.",

        "body": "I went through the MechE program at Baylor and am now working in mechanical/electrical role. Here are my thoughts:\n\n* The most objective way to think about this is to look at course catalogs for both [Baylor's MechE program](https://www.ecs.baylor.edu/index.php?id=961316) (course catalog [here](https://www.baylor.edu/registrar/index.php?id=84879), flowchart [here](https://www.ecs.baylor.edu/doc.php/356675.pdf)) and [another school's CivE program (using TAMU as an example)](https://catalog.tamu.edu/undergraduate/engineering/civil-environmental/bs-structural-engineering-track/#programrequirementstext). Most of the differences appear in the junior and senior level elective courses. See what available elective courses excite you and which don't.\n \n* Another way to approach it is to look up entry level jobs you ideally would like to have and see what the degree requirements are. \n\n* I agree with /u/FrequentLandscape392 in that there's a lot of overlap between mechanical engineering and civil engineering. Both need to take some form of statics, dynamics, material mechanics, fluids, etc. I think the biggest thing you'd be missing out on by doing mechanical over civil is some of the geotechnical engineering/surveying, discussions on code and policy, traffic, concrete, etc (with more math classes and thermodynamics/heat transfer in their stead). In the worst case, you could probably easily transfer the first 2-3 years of mechanical engineering studies to a civil engineering program.\n\n* I do know of some MechE's I graduated with that ended up working for CivE firms. The biggest thing for CivE's is passing the FE exam en route to becoming a professional engineer. The [FE exam](https://ncees.org/engineering/fe/) can be taken in different disciplines, civil and mechanical being two distinct options. Review what is covered in both exams to help distinguish between the two.\n\n* I will say, personally, I do believe MechE gives you more options than CivE in case you change your mind about working in construction (don't discount that happening...I walked into college absolutely sure I wanted to go into automotive, walked out absolutely sure I wanted to work in aerospace, and now I'm happily doing neither of those things). CivE is a very broad field with plenty of variety (structural, hydrology, earth sciences, etc.), but it does sort of push you into construction/geotechnical work. MechE gives you more opportunity to jump to something even further outside of that, like automotive or aerospace. If you *know* you want to be in construction, then CivE is the way to go.\n\n* I've been in the workforce about 5 years now. Almost everything that I use in my job daily were things I learned while working at the job...that is to say, most of the specific knowledge you will need to be successful you will pick up in the workforce. As long as you're within the right physics area with your degree (mechanical physics, not electrical or chemical), I believe that a civil engineering firm will happily take you at graduation and start training you in the specifics of that field. Engineering school, on top of teaching you things that are specific to your field of engineering, teaches you a way of thinking and how to approach problems, which is transferable across engineering disciplines.\n\nI hope that helps some. Ultimately, as long as you go to an ABET accredited school (which any established university will be) and you go somewhere where you think you can be successful, I think you'll do just fine. I know all of this sounds scary now, but I promise you that when you're a few years into your career, you will look back and wonder why you ever worried.",

ME and Civil are pretty common together in that job requirement.\n\nI had at least one offer for a Civil Engineering role. I believe that's pretty common for Civil and Mech engineers to be hired interchangeably at many places.  Most job applications say they require an engineering degree in x, y, or z engineering discipline. \n\nMy internship was doing engineering drawings for water treatment plants and they offered me a job.  My first job was aircraft structural design working closely with the Stress Engineers which was a mix of Civil and Mechanical.  I made my way into production engineering, then sustainment/MRB engineering for the same company.  Followed that up with Field Service Engineering Support and Failure Analysis in the Wind Industry, and now Systems Engineering back in Aerospace.  That was all in just under 10 years.  \n\nYour career can take you all over the place.  My opinion is that what matters in picking a school is to have a plan for where you want to start and make sure the school is a good fit for what you need to succeed as well as your personal beliefs, which for me, Baylor excelled in.  As long as they offer accredited engineering programs you'll be alright and there is always the option to tailor your skills with a Master's Degree or certification of some sort.",

Both are similarly academically ranked, but Baylor has been climbing a lot lately thanks to increased investment in graduate research, whereas I think TCU has stayed pretty much the same.

Personally, I grew up in a Baylor family so I was always destined to attend Baylor; however, I always felt that Baylor has a great family atmosphere that was very inclusive.  I felt welcomed at all stages of my time in Waco.  When on the TCU campus, the vibe was just different.  Not necessarily good or bad.  Just much different.  Ultimately, both schools will offer you a great college education and likely a wonderful college experience.  \n\nFor illustration of the major culture difference - Baylor people will tell you both schools are great and offer tremendous opportunity for personal and academic growth.  Whereas TCU people will tell you that Waco is garbage and Baylor is full of rapists.  That's probably the best summation of the culture differences that I can offer.",

        "body": "I can't speak for the environmental science department specifically, (I'm a current HNR neuro/pre-med major) so I'll leave question 1 for someone else.\n\nBut trust me, you won't have any trouble finding professors who run research labs in the college of arts and sciences, in and out of your major's department. Most professors are willing to take in students who make contact with them and express interest in their research. Keep an eye out for advertisements for open labs posted around the BSB, if you choose to attend, or pay attention in class because most professors who run a lab love to mention their research at least once and if it's something you may also be interested in, they're probably someone to approach after class or during office hours. \nIf you're doing pre-med though, I'd say research probably isn't where you're going to want to focus most of your efforts. In terms of shadowing/internships, most of those can be achieved through involvement in pre-health organizations on campus or carefully checking the weekly pre-health letter which will be sent through your email and contain links to apply to internships the university thinks will be a good match for the majority of students. Baylor will also set up a handshake account for you where you can attach a resume and receive more specific offers from interested employers or internship programs. You can also apply to additional internships through Handshake. (I recently applied to a summer internship at BCOM through there for example). In terms of the pre-health organizations, most require a certain number of hours of involvement to be an active member and each usually have pre-existing agreements with clinics or programs within Waco that allow their members to volunteer. (I've been in or heard of organizations that have opportunities for hospice work, clinical work, mission work, triage work, memory care homes volunteering, etc.) \nBaylor also offers a mandatory pre-health class called foundations of medicine that requires you to volunteer, join organizations, and go to events around campus to start you off right in your pre-health journey in your first semester. It's a great networking opportunity as well, as it's led by pre-medical upperclassmen who usually can help with advice and guidance. Baylor also offers a non-mandatory class that literally creates shadowing/volunteering opportunities for you in Waco and blocks off time for you every week to go and participate in them as your grade. That class is probably better taken as an upperclassmen however, or at least when you have a car. \nGrading depends on the prof. When you register, use BUbooks.com to check out ratings and see how other students did in the past. (The website looks shady on the browser, but I promise it's a Baylor lifeline).\n\nI won't lie, Waco sucks. Roads aren't great, city isn't great, and you can probably see and do everything to do in Waco within your first week on campus. Lots of people drive up to Dallas or down to Austin for weekend fun. If you stay in Waco on your weekends, there's a few good places to hear live music, and the restaurant scene isn't that bad. There's also restaurants on campus that you can use dining dollars to pay for, or use your meal plan. \n\n I picked Baylor over all of those schools. If you have a decent application, you'll probably get a good sized scholarship from Baylor anyways. I applied and got into Rice, UT Austin, A&M, etc and Baylor's scholarship offer outdid every other offer I received by far. In saying that, choose the school that is right for you and your ambitions. Don't just let someone on the internet tell you what to do. Tour all of your options, do some research, and you'll end up exactly where you're meant to be. \n\nAnyways, Good luck in your college journey and if you have any other questions about Baylor or the college process, feel free to shoot me a DM! I tried to keep it brief here, and I can definitely share more to answer questions 2-4 if needed. Hope this helps!",

The best option is to have one of your friends back home host and then you can connect as a client, but you won't be able to host a private server from Baylor campus. \n\nThe more technical explanation here is that, due to the size and scope of campus and the tens of thousands of devices we network together, we are forced to use Network Address Translation on a very wide, aggressive scale. The particular type of NAT we use is called a one-to-many, where your network address is hidden behind a single public IP alongside with thousands of others. Port forwarding requires a public IP and a one-to-one NAT in order to function, as with one-to-many, there's no easy way to know what NAT'ed IP to forward the client connections to in our setup with clients coming and going all the time.",

This would allow you to still run the server on your laptop (presuming that is a hard requirement for you, and your friends aren\u2019t able to host on your behalf, as u/DarkLordOfAirbear suggested).\n\nThis seems to be a [decent overview of SSH reverse tunneling](https://www.howtogeek.com/428413/what-is-reverse-ssh-tunneling-and-how-to-use-it/). It\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve done this, but IIRC you\u2019d need to use this as a foundation, then setup some additional connections on top of it. I\u2019m also not sure what quirks you may run into using the default ssh client in Windows; I\u2019ve generally used a separate ssh build that comes included with the Git Bash client or been running on Mac or Linux.\n\nIf you do find yourself trying to setup something at a third location, it may eventually be a pain trying to keep track of the IP address of that network (presuming no one is there to easily check on your behalf). In that case, you\u2019d probably benefit from some type of DNS service, and I\u2019d highly recommend the (free!) [DuckDNS](https://www.duckdns.org).\n\nI\u2019d enourage you to play around and figure it out on your own (great learning opportunity), but in a pinch I may be able to track down more details on how I\u2019ve done something similar in the past. I also won\u2019t guarentee this doesn\u2019t violate [Baylor\u2019s technology useage policy](https://www.baylor.edu/risk/doc.php/339230.pdf) in some way (does it count as \u201ccircumvent[ing] technology systems or network security?\u201d My understanding is SSH connections in general are fine, but I\u2019m not sure if tunneling runs afoul of good security practices in this context [university wide network with students doing or tunneling into who knows what].).\n\nE: I also can\u2019t speak to what kind of latency you may experience with this approach and how that may impact what you\u2019re trying to do.\n\nE2: I\u2019ll also add that, depending on the game, you may run into other complications (forwarding TCP-based games is likely different from forwarding UDP-based games). Also, if you can connect straight to your friends, you may only need to open a reverse tunnel to each one, as opposed to some more complicated mixture of forward/reverse tunnels like I was suggesting before (the latter of which may run into issues with multiple people\u2014I think I\u2019ve only ever used it for a single client/server pair).\n\nTL;DR: I won\u2019t say it\u2019s impossible, but it will likely be a complicated mess if you\u2019re unfamilar with ssh and tunneling.",

Ole Miss' defense has improved throughout the year, but I think we have a strength vs weakness in the run game on that side of the ball. \n\nThe strength on strength of this game is Matt Corral vs our defense. He will be the best QB we faced all year and he can gain yards with his legs. Luckily we have speed at the LB position to keep a spy on him. I think we will see that we can bottle up their run game but we are going to see corral get his yards through the air and he will have some demoralizing first down gains with his legs. \n\nUltimately I think our offense's ability to sustain long drives will win this for us.

The data out of South Africa is showing that Omicron has an *80% lower risk* of hospitalizations (https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-22/omicron-has-80-lower-risk-of-hospitalization-new-study-shows?srnd=premium-europe). It has always been true that college aged people are at very low risks of adverse effects of covid.  Remote learning has broadly been a disaster both academically as well as for mental health (suicides are up dramatically among teens and 20s). Why isn't that science important? \n\nTo be clear I've taken the vaccine and gotten a booster and I think others should do so as well but, so far, the data is showing that omicron is a blessing and may even take us to treating covid-19 as endemic just like other covids (common cold) and flus.

If you are interested in doing bench research that focuses on cancer for example, you would need more than simply asking a professor like credentials, possible research experience, resume/CV. \n\nOne of the labs that I inquired asked me to send in 3 faculty letter of recs, attend 3 interviews (two grad, one post doc) and then a trial semester to test dedication. Some labs have a GPA cap like 3.6-3.7+ or higher. Others may have specific upper level courses you would have to take in order to even be considered for the research position. There are some exceptions, but you would have to be really interested and eager about the PI\u2019s research. \n\nBe prepared to cast a wide net because professors take a very long time to reply to your email. If you want any tips/templates in writing an email to the PI of your interest, feel free to dm me. To get started, I would suggest to narrow down your interests and then find professors that align with what you want to do. Read their publications, reach out to other undergraduate research assistants or grad students in that lab and some labs have virtual tours so check that to get a feel of what it is like to be a research assistant. If you do get a meeting with the PI, make sure to ask a lot of questions and be excited about their research. \n\nThe PIs at Baylor are looking for people who are truly passionate about research and how this experience ties with your future pursuits/goals. Dedication and persistence as well as doing the assigned role well is important. If you are doing research for resume or for the sake of getting into med school and if that comes of in your email or while meeting with a PI, the chances of you getting a position is very slim.\n\nTo address your second question, upper level chem classes are difficult, but doable. It really depends on how much effort you put in and understanding of the material.",

One of the main benefits of fellows is not having to do a decent amount of the entry level course requirements and I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve already taken all of those as a sophomore. Along with this, I think you need 60 hours outside of the b school so I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s attainable at this point. \n\nLike the other commenter said Baylor just started another business program - Hankamer Scholars. This one is geared more towards students who are just interested in business.

If you go through recruitment in spring, you'll find a house for you. Not everyone in fraternities use drugs/alcohol, but it's a great way to find brotherhood. \n\nFor chapters with involvement: KOT, Phi Chi ATO, KSig Sigma Chi are good. They're the largest chapters, do well and participate in sing and float. They're also consistently good at intramurals and are involved a lot on campus. \n\nOther chapters: delt, pi kapp, SAE: these chapters are a bit smaller and more on the party side. I would say that SAE however is actually involved on campus with float and sing, and that they're more wellrounded. \n\nSmaller chapter: sig ep, beta, teke- these chapters are pretty small. You'll still have your typical brother hood but they are smaller and less well known especially when participating in things like sing, float, and campus involvement.",

        "body": "I\u2019m business (accounting and finance) and got into university scholars and when I got in the people running the program literally told me do not do university scholars if you\u2019re planning in doing business as well - they might have had a different take if I was also doing pre-med. \n\nFull disclosure for this next part, I\u2019m in Business Fellows. \n\nI would say that almost everyone doing pre-med with business is a business fellow. Happy to talk more about fellows, but just to sum it up, it\u2019s kind of like a create your own courseload with an emphasis on business classes. Students graduate with a B.B.A in business fellows (essentially a general business degree) and have to take 60 hours outside of the business school (in your case that would be pre-med classes). Along with the B.B.A in business fellows, you graduate with degrees in every other major you\u2019d like. For example, I\u2019m majoring in accounting, finance, business fellows, and minoring in math. My pre-med friend is majoring in biochemistry, finance, business fellows, and minoring in math and is going to med school. \n\nTo my knowledge, in University Scholars you graduate with some type of bachelors in University Scholars with no other major (instead of other majors you have areas of emphasis). I could be wrong here, but that\u2019s what I remember about the program. The downside of this is that I don\u2019t know if other schools really know what university scholars is. \n\nAlong with this, I believe the honors program in general, university scholars included, is more grad school focused, although a thesis/practicum is required in business fellows as well. I think you should get more information about the ability to do business classes with USchol. If you\u2019re just looking to take a few classes, it should be no problem, but if you want to major/do an area of emphasis in business, I\u2019d make sure that\u2019s possible. \n\nAs far of the competitiveness, I\u2019d say USchol and Business Fellows are pretty similar with avg ACT around 33 (and whatever SAT correlates to that) and top high school performance.",

It\u2019s very competitive to get into and while I am not an University Scholar, although former BIC Honors student, the program is very rigorous in both reading and writing. University scholars gives you the freedom to choose whatever concentration you want so of course you can add business as a concentration. It takes most of your Gen Eds away which is awesome and gives a lot of flexibility to the courses that you can take at Baylor. University Scholars program guarantees a medical acceptance is what I\u2019ve heard since you are getting the opportunity to write a thesis (looks great on a resume and research is important for med school) along with being a holistic student taking diverse classes and pursuing various activities. \n\nI would say that the only con to this program is it\u2019s a lot of work and classes are very rigorous so you will have double the work/ difficulty compared to your other peers outside of the honors college. And this program is essentially for people who are driven and want to explore the breadth and depth of what Baylor has to offer while also enhancing individual growth and pursuing what it really interests you. I would say it will be definitely worth it if you are willing to put in the effort and optimize what Uschol has to offer for you. \n\nAdditionally, the people you meet are just absolutely amazing along with the community honors college bestows upon its students. Welcome to Baylor. Looking forward to having you on campus next year.",

But if you want to, we're not going to stand in your way, and the full price tuition you're paying will subsidize the kids we actually do want to come here.\"\n\nIf you have rich parents, they probably won't care. I knew people for whom that was the case. But going to Baylor at full price and paying for it with loans would be a *very bad* idea and I would strongly advise against it.",

But I think the reason it jumped so high is probably a combo of pandemic uncertainty and reduced enrollment last year, and them trying to grow as a school (they were bragging about this during grad school orientation).

We rehearse less than about 75% of bands out there, but still look and sound just as good, and any college band director would tell you that. We still do challenging shows, despite the limited rehearsal time, and our directors aren't afraid to try new things with us (see our Men's basketball national championship show from this year!)\n\nBeyond the music, the ensemble has an excellent atmosphere of excellence, support, energy, and family love. There's not a single section in the band that won't welcome you and treat you like family. The band directors really care about each member and care about us as people and not just musicians. \n\nBUGWB has been the most important part of my college career thus far. Marching band was my life in high school. I loved every moment of it, so I knew I wanted to go to a college that had a marching band, but I also wanted to go to a Christian school (I'm planning to go into ministry), so Baylor was really my only option in that regard. It has turned out to be the perfect fit for me though! It has fostered all of my favorite moments as a Bear, and has created a wonderful social group for me to be a part of. I honestly can't speak highly enough of it!\n\nBeing in BUGWB also opens to door to be apart of our other ensembles: Fall Ball Band (volleyball and soccer) as well as Courtside (basketball band), which are both tons of fun, and you can have the opportunity to travel with the volleyball and basketball teams in their respective NCAA tournaments!\n\nPlease ask any and all questions you might have. If I don't have an answer, I'll know where to direct you to find one!",

Bald Aars and Speegle both taught me languages that I use in my current Big Data job (Bash and SQL respectively), and Hairy Aars (yes, OP, that's how we distinguish between the brothers) taught me Capstone, which was my #1 favorite course in the entire program. Therefore, I'm probably biased in their favor, and ***YMMV***.\n\nDid you take Cerny for Software Engineering 1 before taking Donahoo for Networking? I took Song and Cho (who is no longer on the [ECS faculty list](https://ecs.baylor.edu/index.php?id=961249)) instead for SE1 and Intro to Java respectively, and, as a result, I felt woefully unprepared for the hellfire that is Networking. I'm curious if the change to Cerny gave students a better foundation in Java prior to Donahoo expecting a ton from them in Networking.\n\nEdit: Apparently Lin isn't there anymore either, which makes me sad. I know people who took him for Algorithms a year after me didn't have such a great time, but I loved him in that class and took him again for Natural Language Processing because of my positive experience.

I eventually decided that I\u2019d give the school a genuine chance where I wasn\u2019t stepping on my toes socially and academically. I\u2019m sure your situation is different from mine, especially because I didn\u2019t have financial concerns, but my second year I truly found my niche in the school with some great roommates. The school will definitely grow on you if you stick it out but if the financial concerns are too much, considering cheaper schools might be the best moves. Some of my friends from high school who had those same concerns went to community college for a couple years to make college cheaper. If you\u2019re not completely repulsed by the idea of community college, you should also consider that.",

That was my major going into Baylor, and SFA was my second choice because their School of Music is bomb.\n\nAlso, just want to say that I was in a very similar position around the end of my first semester. I highly considered transferring to A&M just because my best friend was there and I knew I wouldn't be alone. The transition to college, especially for someone who was very involved in HS (as I was as well) can feel very isolating, and for me, it just took finding the right group to get through it. I ended up finding friends through church, my sorority (which, btw, can often offer financial assistance for dues), and band, but it took time. I don't have much advice as far as the financial struggle, but I'm happy to chat about finding you place if you want to message me.\n\nBest of luck!!",

I emailed this to both violin professors in that same month. No response. I did this every month until my audition. I auditioned and was not accepted. I felt very defeated, but I emailed both professors asking for feedback. No response. Again, I emailed them once a month for about 3-4 months.\nI understand they\u2019re busy, covid, etc. but it really discouraged me when I couldn\u2019t even learn what I did wrong at my audition. Now, I wanted to audition for next semester. As guided by Dr Alexander, I emailed the violin professors to see if I could set up a lesson with them. No response. \nAt this point, I\u2019ve lost hope in the school of music at Baylor. I emailed Mary Sage for help back in March and she did not really help, just told me to keep trying.\nI was really passionate about music education, but now if I stay at Baylor, I can\u2019t pursue what I want to pursue. \nI also think the audition is far too demanding (memorizing two pieces?) to not be offered help or even feedback.",

First, remember that Baylor kicked the field goal the first time with 1 min + left and then the penalty got them the first down. I say that because it\u2019s not like it was a last minute slam on OU. It\u2019s all about the Big 12 championship game. If there\u2019s a tie, the Big 12 considers head to head matchups and then the point spread. Baylor lost to OSU by 10. We needed to beat OU by more than 10 to play the Big 12 championship game in case of a 3 way tie. Coach Aranda knew that going in. So now if OSU beats OU we\u2019re in because we have the head to head win. If OU beats OSU and OU loses to Iowa State we\u2019re in because of the point spread.

They offer a shuttle that runs every 15 minutes from 7:30 to about 4:50 (there is about a 5 to 7 minute delay from when the shuttle leaves Domain to when it drops you off near Cashion) which has nullified any driving issues for me. The only time you drive for classes is if you missed the shuttle or if you have classes later, at which I recommend having a friend pick you up. \n\nLast thing is if you do bring your car, you don't have to buy a parking spot. They have plenty for free use, I've never had an issue parking here.\n\nBonus points to the shuttle driver, he's rad and he reminds you of the free breakfast on Mondaysand the lunches on Fridays!",

The programming assignments I did in school gave me experience with many things that are ridiculously similar to things I have to deal with at work.\n\nDifferent people will find different aspects difficult. I really enjoyed the programming assignments, but I never did as well on the paper exams unless they were multiple choice. I had a harder time with the non-CS courses, a lot of which could've been avoided by being more selective about which professors I got. Check [http://bubooks.com/profrate.php](http://bubooks.com/profrate.php) to read reviews.\n\nAs far as getting the job in the first place, the odds of you getting the job off of prestige are low, but if you can get the interview, you'll certainly be prepared to do well. There are lots of opportunities at the career fairs. I don't remember anyone graduating without a job lined up. Some of them might not have been as good paying as others, but everyone had something. The job title is generally some variant of \"Software Engineer.\"\n\nInternships are another issue. When I was there, they always talked about how it's possible to get an internship after your first year. I think it is much more likely, without past experience or personal connections, you won't be getting an internship until after your junior year. If you can get interviews before that it's great to have the practice, but don't expect any offers.",

Enjoy the off time that you currently have. The first module of Ochem is Chem 1 review: Formal Charges, Bond Theory, Atomic Orbitals, Physical Properties, etc. Suffice to say, you will be eased into things.\n\n**I'm signed up to take Zinke--do you have any experience with him?**\n\nPlenty of people love Zinke, plenty others struggled in the class. I'm in the camp that thinks he's great! Check out what others think on [BUBooks](http://www.bubooks.com/profdisplay.php?profid=2382).\n\n**What materials do I need to buy?**\n\nI would recommend buying the Baylor editions of the Klein textbooks in the Bookstore--it's a softcover packaged with the answer book which has room to work through the problem sets & additional questions and is newly updated. The 4th edition differs from the 3rd, not by a lot, but enough. Molecular model kits are optional, but if you need one there are cheaper molecular model kits online. Most do fine w/o, just ask the SI's if you're really having trouble, or look up structures on PubChem.\n\n**What does doing well mean in Orgo?**\n\nThink about what your goals should be for the class. Zinke always gives the same recommendations to his Premed students on every syllabus day: 1) Get an A. 2) Get a recommendation letter. 3) Learn the material. Of the 3, the 3rd is the hardest and requires the most time and effort. \n\n**What's the best way to study for Orgo?**\n\nPractice problems. Do them as you read through the textbook and do the recommended ones at the end of each chapter. I'll say it again. *Do the book problems.* Your enjoyment and understanding of Orgo is proportionate to the number of practice problems you are doing. Orgo is qualitative/conceptual, and learning these concepts is a discrete process. Understand everything in Zinke's notes: anything in them is testable material. If you can learn the material, you will get an A. Zinke's tests are very fair.\n\nAdditional Resources: I found Klein's supplemental texts to be invaluable: [*Organic Chemistry as a Second Language*](https://libgen.is/search.php?req=organic+chemistry+as+a+second+language&lg_topic=libgen&open=0&view=simple&res=25&phrase=1&column=def). [masteringorganicchemistry] (https://www.masterorganicchemistry.com/) is a great resource for comprehensive explanations. \n\n**What do you think is that main reason that people do badly?**\n\nPeople who haven't figured out what best study habits work for them find  It's difficult to allocate your time to numerous \"upper\" level courses at the same time.

I've taken brit lit and world lit, and they both had essay questions each exam. Humphries has no essay questions, although there is an essay assignment that I haven't gotten to yet. But the reason Humphries is easy is because she basically reads you the exam questions the day before.\n\nI had mcdonald for world lit. He is probably the hardest grader I've had, but it was also the most enjoyable of the 3 classes I took. I think I had Calloway for British lit.  Decent class overall, just not as easy as humphries.",

        "body": "1. Research opportunities are plentiful, but usually not until sophomore or junior year; professors want to see that you're established as a quality science student before letting you into their vital research. Keep in mind that, as an undergrad, you cost them more time/effort in supervision than you contribute in your work for a while, so they want to see you're worth investing that time/effort into.\n2. Classes are very tough in order to separate out the great students from the good students. Do not enter pre-med if you are not prepared for your life to be hell at times. Being a successful pre-med will often mean sacrificing fun times out with friends and missing out on other fun college experiences. It's often believed that pre-meds who drop are people who can't make the grades. This is true the first semester or two, but after that a surprisingly large chunk is people who *can* make the grades but just don't find it worth it any more. The best tip about class difficulty I can tell you is: very few classes in the pre-med track are *individually* difficult. What's hard is balancing an entire courseload of 15-17 \"medium-hard\" hours. Being a successful engineering or CS student is about how math-brain smart you are. Being a successful pre-med is about how organized and dedicated you are.\n3. Having not attended any other universities for undergrad, I can't give much guidance on this\n4. There are advisors who can help you know what to apply for, where to apply, and how to put out the best applications, but they won't just \"get\" you valuable experiences. Internships are highly highly competitive and usually just come down to resumes, essays, and interviews. Volunteering is best found through clubs. Clinical jobs (scribing, stretcher-pushing, etc) and shadowing are a mixed bag of entry points and requirements but not too hard to find if you try; I would recommend doing these in the summer. Clubs are also a good starting point for finding these. You can't get access to the actual pre-med committee advisors as a freshman, but the best things you can do freshman year are just make good grades and get involved in a club. The specialization and clinical experience comes later. I cannot emphasize enough the importance of freshman year grades. You want to ace these easy classes to give you wiggle room for the hard ones later.\n5. Very strong. One of the best in Texas and the entire southwest. The committee here does not fool around and will make sure any applicants they recommend for med school are well prepared. It's important to remember that the quality of *you* matters a lot more than the quality of your school, but Baylor certainly does its part. You can get into any med school in the country from here if you're good enough, but the name on your diploma alone won't get you into even a bottom-tier MD school, even if you went to an Ivy.\n6. Depends on what you're used to. Church small groups are the easiest way to make friends on campus if you're not Greek, so they're extremely popular even among people that don't actually show up to church that much, if at all. If you've grown up in the suburban south, it will be a fairly typical experience. If you're a coastal, it might freak you out a bit. It's not overwhelming, though; lots of nonreligious people thrive here. Even though the school is officially a Baptist university, the ways it will affect you personally are mostly cultural rather than official.\n\nEDIT: Also just want to mention that your best advisors at times can be not just your actual advisors but your professors and, even more importantly, upperclassmen. Find someone older than you and get their advice on everything. Unlike advisors and even professors, they're the ones actually going through it from the student's perspective themselves. They're also free to give the dirt on which professors to avoid in ways you're not gonna hear from a school employee.",

Turns out you need to be good at calculus and physics to be an engineer. Who would\u2019ve thunk? \n\nAnyway, first semester was stressful and I edged by with the skin of my teeth, however the second semester I finished with my highest grade being a C-. I was dropped from the engineering program and felt destroyed. I switched my Major to Biology, no not pre-med just regular biology because I\u2019m one of those nerds who just enjoys science. With how horrendous my freshman year was my GPA was so low that I still graduated with a 2.91 upon graduation. Guess what though? I still got a job as a lab manager/research tech at a top ranked institution and am now a year into my PhD studies in Biomedical Sciences with my name on 5 publications before the year is over. My point is not to boast, but to say life is more than your GPA. While your GPA might be one attribute looked at it\u2019s not real representation of who you are, what you are passionate about, or what you are skilled in. \n\nThat being said I\u2019m not sure if you are afraid of scholarship probation or academic probation. If it is the former, I highly suggest scheduling meetings with the financial aid department. You can appeal to keep your scholarship after you get put on scholarship probation. In my case I had to do it every semester and I was able to keep my scholarship every semester because I continually proved I was able to keep my semester GPA above a 3.0 since switching majors. It was a relatively easy process (between 2015-2019 at least). \n\nPlease feel free to DM if you have any extra questions! :) \n\nGood luck on finishing this semester strong!",

I finished my last 4 semesters with a 3.8 or higher and managed to pull my overall GPA to a 3.2. I didn't make a change in my behavior until start of my junior year, so you have plenty of time. \n\nHere's what I did to change things:\n\n1. I made school a priority over friends, going out, and video games. I thought college was supposed to be having fun the whole time, and treated school as a chore. Starting my junior year I became obsessed with getting a 100% on every single grade. Every homework, quiz, extra credit. I had my back up against the wall so that motivated me.\n\n2. I started studying with groups. Instead of just doing it alone I socialized and found the super try hard people in my classes and became friends with them. They would almost always have better notes/ and would remember things from lectures better than me. Spending time with them preparing for the test would almost always give me some important info to know that I had missed since I'm not very good at paying attention during lectures. I picked up their study habits and eventually I became the try hard who could help out others. When you are able to teach others the material that's when you know you'll make a good grade on the test.\n\n3. I started bringing my textbook to lectures where I couldn't pay attention. I have an incredibly hard time sitting still and watch a professor go over the power point. I started bringing my book to class and just straight up reading the chapter during lectures. When it was time to study for a test I would just read all the chapters again, by then it was second or third time reading the material so I had it basically memorized. Reading comprehension is my strength though so it might not work for everyone \n\n4.Flashcards. Flashcards changed everything. It's the best way to memorize for me. Quizlet is what I used since sometimes people already had the Flashcards made. \n\nI managed to turn my shitty 3.2 GPA into a career where I am currently working for an Ivy League school. There's much more to getting a job than your GPA. Good luck!\n\nHope this helps. Good luck!",

I can't speak for you, but if you're feeling burnt out don't be afraid to talk to an academic advisor about potentially changing majors. They can walk you through options, maybe even some that have overlaps in classwork with what you've already done, and if director of that major/program would probably be happy to meet with you to chat as well. I switched to International Affairs before my *fifth year* as an undergrad and it was the best decision I've ever made.\n\n2. Don't freak out too much about failing classes. Assuming this system still exists, you can always re-take them in a subsequent semester/summer if offered. The grade you get the second time replaces the grade you get the first in terms of GPA calculations. \n\n3. As others have mentioned, GPA isn't everything. In fact, it's not much of anything. Keep it above 3, sure, but it will only be taken into consideration for the very first job you get out of college and even then can be supplemented by other experience (volunteering, internships, etc.).

We are using OBS and actually playing our game live at one table. Your support is appreciated. Like you said, on Fridays we stream our D&D 5E campaign, and on Sundays we generall have stream Footnotes, where we have a few people on to talk about that week's session, talk with chat, and discuss TTRPG content. This Sunday we are doing a Halloween one-shot during that time instead.   \n\n\nCurrently we only have a 5E campaign running, but are working on getting started with more systems in the near future!  \n\n\nWe totally understand that not everyone can catch us live, and we post the streams on [our YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCm2TsqbUh7QXqmbTbQ8M3pg) two days after.",

IMO the easiest/best place would be , i'd go parking by[ Coaches xXx smoke house downtown](https://goo.gl/maps/izmYcvqLNoJtsTHZ9). at the corner of Austin and 3rd they have a shuttle system that is shockingly efficient. i used to pay to park on campus, but stopped because this was faster. parking DT is pretty easy, most the lots are free, its easy to follow the crowd.\n\n* tailgates have a [dedicated section](https://imgur.com/a/WlrylVA). \n\nbtw one cool unique thing about our stadium is we have pretty good wifi and with the[ baylor](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.yinzcam.ncaa.bay&hl=en_US&gl=US) app you can get live camera feeds from all the cameras in the satdium. the place is so small and the views so good i've never really used it much, but its a pretty cool thing to mess around with. \n\nhope you have fun at the game! highly suggest going to Don Carlos after the game, its on the way back to austin and far enough from the stadium that you get seated quickly. also they have plenty of TVs to catch the rest of the games.",

Also it's nice to take a class with other freshman who may not share your major, you might make lifelong friends like I did.\n2. There are a ton! A lot of the psych professors do research and I know numerous people who work in their labs. If research is something that really interests you, maybe look into the Science Research Fellows program. I'd love to talk more about that if you'd like.\n3. Science Fellows is pretty distinct, no one else has anything like that in the country as far as I am aware. I'm sure there are many other unique things but none truly come to mind. What I can say is that though every University will have many of the same programs, each has their own spin and Baylor is wonderfully unique and there's nothing like it in the country.\n4. Not a psych major but I am in intro to psych with Dr Lawrence and it's wonderful. She also teaches a relationships class which I have heard a lot of good things about. Dr. Scullin is also a world-renowned sleep researcher and he teaches here\n\nFeel free to ask me any other questions about Baylor!",

She was super understanding when I was going through a rough patch and even let me take my final at a different time because I had some days switched up. Christian scriptures and heritage are fun too if you have a good class. \n\n2. There are tons of research opportunities! I helped some grad students with a study they were working on and I know they always need help in the various labs. You just have to ask!\n\n3. Science fellows is unique, but so is University Scholars. It's a cool major. \n\n4. In the psych department I adored Dr. Riley. He goes SO above and beyond for his students. Cannot recommend him enough. Dr. Rowatt is also brilliant and I took nearly every class he offered. \n\nThe professors are what make Baylor a great school, in my opinion. Definitely make an effort to talk to them and get to know them! They will nearly always help you out. I took over 180 hrs of classes in undergrad at Baylor and I only ever had one professor I didn't like, but that's because it was Calculus. \n\nThe psych department at Baylor is fantastic. Additionally if you happen to be interested in Philosophy, Dr. Rowatt in the psych department and Dr. Evans in the philosophy department both do areas of research that combine the two. Super fascinating stuff.",

I had credit from AP Psych to cover my intro to psych class, but you\u2019ll be required to take a New Student Experience for psychology/neuroscience. I don\u2019t honestly understand the purpose of this class as it involves watching weekly lectures & posting weekly discussion boards. It\u2019s very easy material, but it doesn\u2019t pique my interest much. Do be sure that you read on Baylor\u2019s Christian traditions because I was not expecting such a heavy Christian influence in all of my classes (despite it obviously being a Baptist school). I liked Baylor\u2019s programs but I\u2019m not religious so I feel so out of place, haven\u2019t made any friends.",

I understand you want students to be diverse in their studies, but if I get an A in the first lit class, why can't I skip the rest? I'm probably never gonna need to talk to my employers about the literary devices of the odyssey. I wonder if I'll ever need to know the themes associated with William Faulkner. Like I get it, they were influential to modern writing styles. But damn I didn't need 4 semesters of it.

Didn\u2019t drop the class - again, didn\u2019t know that was a thing - walked into the final basically needing a.100 and a miracle to pass. It was clear 3 minutes into looking at the exam it wasn\u2019t going to happen. Walked out after 5 minutes to much muffled chatter and scoul from the prof. Failed. Dug a huge hole in my GPA. Managed a B+ the next semester. Climbed out of the GPA hole eventually (pretty much 4.0 the last 3 years) and reached the goal.",

George's has chicken fried steak, but make sure you sit in the bar area and not the restaurant area. If you're looking for good food, check out Cajun Craft, Milo, or Union Hall. Postgame, go to Pollo Palenque on La Salle and get some al pastor or barbacoa tacos and a Big Red. It's a yellow food truck at a gas station and it's usually open till 2am.\n\nAs far as tailgating goes, most of the official spots are north of the river and east of the pedestrian bridge right near the stadium. There's also a private tailgating lot north of MLK. Not sure about the best route to the stadium.\n\nI'd probably skip the DP museum and go walk around downtown Waco, check out campus, or go see Magnolia if that's your thing.

You can get the same performance as a Mac for about 40% of the price, plus you can actually game on it which is nice to have (especially if you're hanging out with CS social groups).\n\nAs others have mentioned, Unix-based systems are easier to set up programming environments on (particularly with Bash), but you can get something called Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) to get a real Ubuntu terminal on your Windows. It's what I use for personal programming to this day, and the setup is more than worth it to get all the benefits of a Unix system while still having a Windows otherwise. I can't recommend WSL enough for any programmer working on a PC who also likes Bash and apt-get. Further, when you're doing your Systems Programming class (which is when you'll be writing Bash scripts and stuff), you'll be doing so on the school's remote-accessed Linux boxes rather than just on your own computer.\n\nSetting up programming stuff on a Windows isn't nearly as hard as it used to be, and if you're doing Baylor Intro to CS classes, those use C++ and the professors will be using Windows-based IDEs like CodeBlocks and Microsoft Visual Studio, so it will actually be easier to follow along at first.\n\nThere are 3 good reasons to prefer a Mac over a PC:\n\n1. You just really prefer Mac interfaces/workflows (this is the big one; knowing your preferred machine well is way more important for programming than having the \"ideal\" OS)\n\n2. You are a member of certain social groups that view Apple products as a status symbol and use of non-Apple phones/computers as a sign of poverty\n\n3. You do a lot of creative work like photoshop, video editing, graphic design, etc. One thing you'll notice in tech is that web dev-focused firms tend to be primarily Mac shops. Creative software tends to be a lot more widely available/viable on Mac than PC, very similarly to how gaming is much more widely viable on PC.\n\nIn any other scenario, I would go PC. Also, I think this is already what you're thinking, but 100% go laptop over desktop unless you're doing seriously high-level gaming/creative stuff. A wise man once said: \"college is basically just sitting different places with your laptop,\" so you want to have said laptop.",

This isn't something automatic updates does, and it can make a big difference in what your experience is on the WiFi. It's not an overly complicated process and doesn't need to be done more than maybe once a year, but most new PC's ship with drivers several years out of date.\n\nMac products automatically take care of wireless updates alongside OS updates so it's not as much of an issue, though we have on extremely rare occasion had an instance where Apple pushed an update that broke WiFi for anyone who got it.

That said, considering possible workflows is something that\u2019s really interesting to look at, though not super necessary. The rest of this post will just be me talking through some workflow examples just for the heck of it, but;\n\nTL;DR/DC  - honestly doesn\u2019t matter, just have something with 8+ gb of ram and a processor within the last 4-5 years or so. \nPersonally I find myself with multiple tab-saturated chrome windows often enough that 16gb is a nice luxury, but 8 is more thsn enough to survive without feeling horribly bottlenecked. 4 is unacceptable nowadays\n\n\nPersonally at the moment, I\u2019m running an i5 Inspiron 3567 because it\u2019s just the laptop I had coming into Uni, and I there\u2019s nothing it can\u2019t do for me yet; I\u2019ve got my c++ workflow setup for Intro CSI with g++ and VSCode, and primarily use Google docs for my other class work. It\u2019s a bit lacking in raw hardware, but it\u2019s not like I\u2019m gaming on it or anything. \n\nFor my ideal setup, I\u2019d like to purchase a mactop of some kind as my daily driver for a couple of reasons: The first and foremost being the Mac workflows u/thetrain23 mentioned. I have an iPhone & use an iPad Pro for notes, and having integration between those AND my laptop for things like messaging, calendars, notes (though I don\u2019t use apple notes much) contacts & notifications would be such an awesome productivity feature. I could then also convert my inspiron to an Ubuntu or Arch distro for my dev-projects and for more experience with linux systems in general, seeing as I do things that would benefit from it.\n\nThat said, you may not prefer or even use apple apps in a way that that\u2019s even remotely beneficial. If youre planning on running this laptop for a significant period of time/throughout your Uni career, you may want to go with a windows build since its a little more universal. Before i considered bringing my desktop down, I was considering saving for a fairly new/top end MSI laptop with a gpu, and a dock/monitors for my room. That would\u2019ve allowed me plenty facilities for classwork, and also the ability to keep up with games & any video/rendering work I want to do for the next 4-however many years (and considering my desktop 1080 is still killing it in the graphics dept, i feel like a 30 series card would likely do just that) \n\nThat\u2019s all just some food for thought. If you have any other questions, feel free to ask!",

If you go to a large state school, there might be thousands of students in your class. At Baylor, the ECE class is fairly small. While this might seem like a detractor to some, I was really blessed by this because I was able to form really strong connections to all of the ECE faculty at Baylor, which wouldn\u2019t have happened at a state school. Those connections have helped me in so many different ways. \n\nWith respect to getting a job, you should be able to get a great job right out of undergrad. Many top companies such as Raytheon, Lockheed Martin, and AT&T recruit heavily from Baylor. \n\nI wanted a job from a tech company that typically recruits from top 10 engineering schools. My professors were able to connect me with the right people to get an interview. I got the job because of my experience outside of class, my recommendations, and my social skills (which most engineering schools don\u2019t teach).\n\nMy advice to people is that if you can find a major and school that will help you grow and you set yourself apart, then that will get further than a school that you\u2019re only going to for brand recognition. \n\nHope this helps!",

I know a music major applying this cycle. \n\nThe main downside of tacking on another major is that you'll be taking near 18 hours every semester. Ask yourself, will you be able to balance a heavy class load and also be active in your interests outside of school? Will you be able to join a research lab? When will you study for the MCAT? Most importantly, will you have time to enjoy yourself and make connections with new friends? \n\nIf you truly know that medicine is for you, there are no \"other options\". If you have interests in a career in business I would urge you to pursue that route, as it involves significantly less opportunity cost. Getting into med school is competitive, and an additional BA/BS degree isn't much of a boost to an application.",

This way you\u2019ll have a lot of time to go through all the courses and pre-requisites. To declare a major/get in at the business school, you have to meet certain pre-requisites since everyone who applies to Baylor and admitted will be pre-business. That\u2019s something to think about. \n\nIf you are planning on majoring in the sciences, I would recommend that you take up a minor in entrepreneurship. I am a sophomore and I still have enough space to get in that minor. Also the premed courses are very rigorous so maybe a minor would help since you would need to literally prioritize them over your business classes if you are wanting to go into medicine as a physician profession. \n\nAlso, if you are stats are really high, I would encourage you to apply for the University Scholars program at the Honors college since that unique program offers multiple concentrations you can take without having to do many of the Gen Eds except for the religion classes.

        "body": "Yes and yes. Here are some tips that I\u2019ve picked up over the years:\n\n1. Get a list of companies coming and research a few that you are really interested in. I don\u2019t know how they\u2019re doing it now, but for the last career fair, you could search by the areas of study requested, type of job (full-time vs internship), level of education, etc. Keep in mind that some companies will list all majors.\n\n2. For those companies only, create custom resumes that are tailored to them. Find out what positions they\u2019re offering and try to apply ahead of time if you can, but you may not be able to since some will want you to apply through Handshake and others won\u2019t. Also, GET YOUR RESUME REVIEWED BEFORE USING IT. Ideally by someone in your field of study if possible.\n\n3. Prep an elevator pitch. You\u2019ve probably heard of this before, but just Google if if not. The Career Center will help you with this if you ask.\n\n4. Print both your custom resumes and several copies of your generic resume and stick them in a folder or clipboard that you\u2019ll carry with you to the fair. Leave space for all of the recruiting materials you\u2019ll be offered at the fair.\n\n5. Get to the fair early and make sure you enter on time. Go directly to your top company first so they have a higher chance of remembering you (and so you beat the lines). Break out that elevator pitch and see what happens! Remember, these recruiters will see many, many students today - your goal is for them to remember you out of a sea of faces. Be impressionable and fantastic. Knowing things about the company beforehand and remarking on them leaves an impression.\n(Side note: you want them to remember you for good things. I distinctly remember a particular recruiter because their handshake was more limp than a cold McDonald\u2019s fry. Don\u2019t be that person.)\n\n6. Once you\u2019ve hit all of your companies, do a lap around the fair and see if you find anything else interesting (that\u2019s what the extra copies are for).\n\nBest of luck, and my DMs are open if you have further questions!\n\nEDIT: added spacing whoops",
